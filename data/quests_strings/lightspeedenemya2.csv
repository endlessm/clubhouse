LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_QUESTION,The new enemy in Lightspeed isn't working quite right. Can you help me out with it?,Ada,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_QUEST_ACCEPT,I'd love to,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_LAUNCH,Launch Lightspeed as usual.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_EXPLANATION,"Last time you added a new enemy, but it's no different than the asteroid. We can make it much more interesting.

Go to the hack panel and let's look at the code for that enemy.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_ASK_PLAY,Try playing now to see if it's working as expected!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE,"Select the Spinner tab and you'll see the code that updates its position.

The function `updateSpinner()` takes care of moving it. The `y` coordinate changes its vertical position on the screen.

Right now we just add 0 to y, so it never changes. Make `y` smaller every tick.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE_HINT1,"For example, every time you see `updateSpinner()`, try subtracting 10 from the `y` coordinate ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE_HINT2,`enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y - 10;`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE_HINT3,Then run the level again and see how your changes affected things.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_ADD_ENEMY_CODE,Select the Spawn tab and make sure the `spawnEnemy` function creates a *spinner* enemy!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_ADD_ENEMY_CODE_HINT1,Make sure to return a `spinner` enemy in the `spawnEnemy` function!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_ADD_ENEMY_CODE_HINT2,Change the `spawnEnemy` function so it produces *spinner* enemies: `return spinner;`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Let's play the level and see if your changes are showing up.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_PLAYING,"Okay, so let's see if those *spinners* can move vertically now.  ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_NOENEMIES,Where did the enemies go? Go back to the Spawn tab and make sure to create some *spinner* enemies.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_NOTMOVING,"No, that's not quite right. The enemies aren't moving up and down yet. Let's go back and try that again.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_GOINGUP,"Almost. You got them to move, but they're going up instead of down. Make `y` smaller instead of larger.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_FINISHLEVEL,"Fantastic work all around! The level's a lot more exciting now, right? Go ahead and beat the level now.",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_SUCCESS,Perfect. Come back later and we can try some other cool ways to change the *spinner*,,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_ABORT,No prob. Check back later and we can do some more coding!,,,,
