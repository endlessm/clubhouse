BLENDERQUEST_WARN1,"So, you're interested in 3D Modeling, <b>{{user_name}}</b>?

Your Hack system has access to Blender, a super-powerful 3D modeling program, through the App Center.

We've combed the web and found good guides to help you get started - and there are many more coming!",estelle,,,
BLENDERQUEST_WARN2,"One important thing before you start - Blender is a complicated program with a lot of commands.

We <b>strongly</b> suggest you plug in a USB mouse with at <b>least</b> 3 buttons so that you can use everything properly.
