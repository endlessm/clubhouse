NEWCURSOR_NOTINSTALLED,"Uh-oh! It looks like <b>GIMP</b> isn't installed!

You need to download it from the App Center if you want to play this activity.

Click the icon named <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">App Center</span></tt> on the Desktop, search for <b>GIMP</b> and install it, then restart this activity.",daemon,,,
NEWCURSOR_GREET1,"Greetings, <b>{{user_name}}</b>. I thought I'd show you a fun way to customize the operating system, today.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_GREET2,"Have you played with the System App at all yet? If not, you could to try the ""Touring the System"" activity before this one, if you want.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_GREET3,"At any rate, in the System App, you could switch your mouse cursor between various different objects - Cheese, a Unicorn, et cetera. You probably had your own idea of what would be a fun cursor, though.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_GREET4,"Good news - today, we're going to make a brand-new cursor, just for you!",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_LAUNCHGLIMPSE,"I'll open up <b>GIMP</b> to start us off - It's an image editing program, a little like Photoshop, if you've heard of that. You can find it on the Desktop if you'd like to use in on your own, later.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_1,"Good, now let's open a template file I've prepared for you. Press (Ctrl + O) to open a file and the dialog will start you out in your <b>Recently Used</b> files. Use the left-hand part of the window to navigate to your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Documents</span></tt> folder, inside your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">home</span></tt> directory - remember that from your previous experiences with creating files and directories?",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_2,"Inside the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Documents</span></tt> folder, you should see a file named <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cursor_template.xmc</span></tt>. Double-click it to open it.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_3,"This image is a little... small, isn't it? To be precise, it's 32 pixels tall, and 32 pixels wide. Nice and tidy. Let's zoom in, so you can get a better look. Press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Z</span></tt> to activate the zoom tool, and click on the center of the image a few times to zoom in. If you go too far, hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> and click to zoom out.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_4,"Now, that's better. You can edit this image as you like - or just add a little color. Press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Shift + B</span></tt> or click on the <b>Bucket Fill Tool</b> on the left side of the screen, then click the <b>black box in front of the white box</b> below the tools to set the color. Color the inside of the gear however you like.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_5,"That looks fine. See the big, black triangle up and to the left of the gear? I put that there so there'd be an obvious click point for this cursor. Now, let's get this cursor into a <b>file type</b> that the operating system can understand as a cursor. Click <b>File</b>, then <b>Export As</b>.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_6,"You'll see a save dialog pop up - it should be asking to save it as <b>cursor_template.xmc</b>, but we need to name it something else. Instead, it should be called <b>mycursor.xmc</b>. Now, click <b>Export</b>.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_7,"Another window will pop up, and this is where we would set the ""clicking target"" of the cursor, as well as the timing of an animation the cursor might have, if you were making an hourglass or watch cursor for the ""busy"" state, maybe. Fortunately, I've already set these, so you can just click <b>Export</b> (yes, for the second time).",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_8,"Now we've got a cursor file! There are still a few things we need to do so the operating system can recognize it, though. I'll open up the <b>Terminal</b> for you - we'll need it for the next few steps.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_9,"Hopefully you started off in your <b>home</b> directory (~). Just to make sure, type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ~</span></tt> and then press <b>Enter</b> to make sure we're there.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_10,"Now, let's delve into the inner workings of the OS. For the next set of instructions, be very careful to type them all in <b>exactly</b> as shown - the files and directories in this part only function if they have specific names.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_11,"Try typing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd .icons</span></tt> and then pressing <b>Enter</b> (Notice the period in front of the folder name). If that worked, excellent. If it produced an error, type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mkdir .icons</span></tt>, press <b>Enter</b>, and then type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd .icons</span></tt> and press <b>Enter</b>.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_12,"Now that we're in the <b>.icons</b> directory. Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> and press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Enter</span></tt> to see what's here. If you created this directory, it'll be empty, if not, there might already be some cursors set up. ",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_13,"Let's make our own directory for our cursor - Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mkdir cursor-gear</span></tt>, press <b>Enter</b>, then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd cursor-gear</span></tt> (and press <b>Enter</b>) to go inside.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_14,"Now, let's get everything in place in this directory. We need to make a small file that tells the operating system that we're only replacing the default cursor. Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">nano index.theme</span></tt> and press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Enter</span></tt>.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_15,"In this file, type the following: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">[Icon Theme]</span></tt> and then, on the next line, type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Inherits=Adwaita</span></tt>",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_16,"Now you can press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + O</span></tt> (O like in Orange) to start the save, press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Enter</span></tt> to confirm the filename, and then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + X</span></tt> to exit back to the Terminal.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_17,"Almost there! Let's make another new directory and go into it - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mkdir cursors</span></tt> then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd cursors</span></tt>",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_18,"Now we need to get that cursor file we made with GIMP into this directory. To copy, we use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cp</span></tt>, and add the place where the file is (our Documents folder), then the place we need the file to go (this folder, which you can see in your prompt). Think of what that might look like...",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_19,"The command we need is <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cp ~/Documents/mycursor.xmc ./</span></tt> Note the space after <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">.xmc</span></tt> ! <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">./</span></tt> is shorthand for ""the directory we're in"". Now, press <b>Enter</b> to confirm the command.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_20,"Let's double-check to make sure that worked -  type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> and press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Enter</span></tt> again, and confirm that you see a file named <b>mycursor.xmc</b> in this directory.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_21,"One last file operation - We need to rename this file in order for the operating system to recognize it. Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mv mycursor.xmc left_ptr</span></tt> then press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Enter</span></tt>. Remember that <b>m</b>o<b>v</b>ing a file to one with a different name is essentially renaming it.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_22,"OK! Let's type in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> one last time to make sure the rename worked. If you see a file named <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left_ptr</span></tt>, it's time to tell the OS to change your cursor!",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_23,"Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme cursor-gear</span></tt> and then press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Enter</span></tt>... and you should see your image replace the mouse cursor!",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_24,"Excellent work! Now, if you wanted to restore the previous cursor, you could type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme cursor-hack</span></tt> and then press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Enter</span></tt>.",saniel,,,
NEWCURSOR_25,"You've done a fantastic job, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Now everyone's going to know that this machine is yours, and if they argue... the proof is in the pointer! I'll see you next time, keep on Hacking!",saniel,hurray,,
