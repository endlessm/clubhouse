POWERUPB1_QUESTION,Ready to try out another powerup?,Saniel,,,
POWERUPB1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Of course!,,,,
POWERUPB1_LAUNCH,Excellent. Let's go back to Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPB1_EXPLAIN,"Let's add a second powerup. For now we want to create BOTH types of powerups at random.

Let's go in the coding panel and I'll show you how this works. So let's take this step by step. ",,,,
POWERUPB1_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Click the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab again and look for the `spawnPowerup()` function.

Right now we're only spawning type 'invulnerable' powerup. So, how do we set it to spawn type 'invulnerable' or type 'blowup'?

Let's use the `pickOne()` function. Can you guess how it works?",,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE_HINT1,"So if you want to return either one or the other, you use `pickOne('invulnerable', 'blowup')`.",,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE_HINT2,"So to return `'invulnerable'` or `'blowup'`, you do 'pickOne('invulnerable', 'blowup')'.",,,,
POWERUPB1_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and play the level.,,,,
POWERUPB1_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPB1_PLAY_AGAIN,Let's try again.,,,,
POWERUPB1_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPB1_PLAYTEST,Let's see if we get both types of powerups.,,,,
POWERUPB1_NOPOWERUPS,Hmm. Now we have no powerups at all. Something went wrong. Let's fix it.,,,,
POWERUPB1_ONETYPEONLY,"We have some powerups, but it's only one type. Are the two types being spawned?",,,,
POWERUPB1_FINISHLEVEL,That's it! We now have both types. Go ahead and finish the level.,,,,
POWERUPB1_SUCCESS,"Splendid. So we have two powerups now, but the second one doesn't yet have its powers. 

Come get me at the Clubhouse and we'll give the second powerup its special power! 

We'll do this just as we did with the first powerup. What powers would you like to add? ",,hurray,,
POWERUPB1_ABORT,No problem. Let's resume work later. ,,,,
