POWERUPB1_QUESTION,Ready to try out another Power-up?,Saniel,,,
POWERUPB1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sounds fun!,,,,
POWERUPB1_LAUNCH,Excellent. Let's go back to Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPB1_EXPLAIN,"Let's add a second Power-up. Let's create BOTH types of Power-ups at random.

Let's go in the coding panel and I'll show you how this works. ",,,,
POWERUPB1_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Click the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE,"Click the Spawn tab. Remember that `spawnPowerup()` function? 

Last time we changed it to say `return 'invulnerable';` 

This time we'll use `pickOne()` to create a Power-up randomly. 

So if you want to return either one or the other, you would say `pickOne('invulnerable', 'blowup')`.",,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE_HINT1,"Instead of returning `'invulnerable'`, return `pickOne('invulnerable', 'blowup')` ",,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE_HINT2,"Change `return 'invulnerable';` to say `return pickOne('invulnerable', 'blowup');`.",,,,
POWERUPB1_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and play the level.,,,,
POWERUPB1_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPB1_PLAY_AGAIN,How about if we try that again.,,,,
POWERUPB1_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Click *Restart*.,,,,
POWERUPB1_PLAYTEST,Here's where we find out if we get both types of Power-ups.,,,,
POWERUPB1_NOPOWERUPS,Hmm. Now we have no Power-ups at all. Something went wrong. Let's fix it.,,,,
POWERUPB1_ONETYPEONLY,"We have _some_ Power-ups, but it's only one type. Are both types being spawned?",,,,
POWERUPB1_FINISHLEVEL,That's it! We now have both types. Go ahead and finish the level.,,,,
POWERUPB1_SUCCESS,"Splendid. So we have two Power-ups now, but the second one doesn't yet have its powers. 

What power would you like to add? ",,hurray,,
POWERUPB1_ABORT,No problem. Let's resume work later. ,,,,
