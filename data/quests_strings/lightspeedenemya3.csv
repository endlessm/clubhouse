LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_QUESTION,Let's keep working on that Lightspeed enemy you made.,Ada,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_QUEST_ACCEPT,"Okay, great.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_LAUNCH,You know the drill: Launch Lightspeed.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_EXPLANATION,"Now that *spinner* enemy moves in a diagonal and goes off screen. Let's make sure it stays on screen.

Let's go to the coding panel again.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE,"Select the Spinner tab and look for the `updateSpinner()` function.

Let's stop making `y` smaller when it becomes less than 0 (the bottom of the screen). Oh look, there's an `if` statement already.

Someone made it so `y` only gets smaller if the enemy's y position is less than 1000. That's not quite right. We call that a bug.

We don't want them going off the bottom of the screen, so let's only make `y` smaller when it is greater than 0.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT1,Now it's checking if `y` is less than 1000. Change it to more than 0.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT2,"Less than 100 is `< 1000`, so what would more than 0 would be?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT3,That's right: `> 0`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT4,So it should be `if (enemy.position.y > 0)` etc.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT5,Don't forget to play the level to check your results.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_PLAYING,Let's see how you did with that.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_NOTMOVING,Something went wrong and now the enemies aren't moving. Go back to the coding panel and let's fix it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_GOINGDOWN,Hmm. they're still going below the screen. Go back and make sure you don't update the y position if they go below 0.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_NOTREACHINGBOTTOM,The enemies aren't quite reaching the bottom of the screen. Check your code again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_SUCCESS,"Perfect. Now they aren't going anywhere. Good job!

By the way, you said earlier you were looking for a 
*ratchet wheel*. I've got one right here. ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_END,"Here, take it. You can have it. You did a great job. See you around.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_ABORT,Check back if you want to explore the coding panel some more!,,,,
