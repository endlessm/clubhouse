POWERUPC3_QUESTION,One more tweak to the Power-up.,,,,
POWERUPC3_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure,,,,
POWERUPC3_LAUNCH,Let's go to Lightspeed again.,,,,
POWERUPC3_EXPLAIN,"For the final touch, let's add another possible random upgrade to the ship. Go to the code.",,,,
POWERUPC3_CODE,"Go to the `activatePowerup()` function on the Power-Up tab. We will give one of 3 upgrades, so the random number should be between 1 and 3.

Then we'll use `ship.engineTimer = 5;` to make the new third upgrade work!  I'm ready to give you hints.",,,,
POWERUPC3_CODE_HINT1,"Change `var r = random(1,2);` to `var r = random(1,3);`",,,,
POWERUPC3_CODE_HINT2,"Then below `ship.attractTimer = 5;`, add a new line that says `if (r === 3)`",,,,
POWERUPC3_CODE_HINT3,Then after that add `ship.engineTimer = 5;`,,,,
POWERUPC3_CODE_HINT4,So the whole thing will say `if (r === 3) ship.engineTimer = 5;`  Then flip back around to test!,,,,
POWERUPC3_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and try the level as usual.,,,,
POWERUPC3_PLAYTEST,You should be able to get all 3 types of upgrades as you play the level...,,,,
POWERUPC3_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press *Restart.*,,,,
POWERUPC3_PLAY_AGAIN,Let's try that level again!,,,,
POWERUPC3_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Press *Restart.*,,,,
POWERUPC3_NOTTHREE,You didn't get all 3 types of upgrades. Weird. See what's going on with that code.,,,,
POWERUPC3_NO_UPGRADE,That Power-up didn't give any upgrade to the ship. Go back and see if an upgrade is specified.,,,,
POWERUPC3_OTHER_PICKED,Did you mean to pick a Power-up of a different type?,,,,
POWERUPC3_NOT_PICKED,No Power-up? Every tiny thing matters in code! Check to make sure they're actually being spawned.,,,,
POWERUPC3_FINISHLEVEL,Perfect. Now you just need to breeze to the end of the level.,,,,
POWERUPC3_SUCCESS,Excellent! You have completed all Power-ups. Now we're ready for the final challenge to get the fob.,,hurray,,
POWERUPC3_ABORT,Check back whenever you're ready!,,,,
