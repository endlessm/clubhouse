LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_QUESTION,We've got our work cut out for us on Lightspeed.,Saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_QUEST_ACCEPT,"Okay, let's get on it!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_LAUNCH,All right. Let's go to Lightspeed again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_EXPLANATION,"Level 4 is somehow quite sparse! We could really use some more asteroids!

Go ahead and flip to hack just as we did before.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab again. The `spawnEnemy()` function is returning null! No wonder there are no asteroids.

Try changing it to `return asteroid;` and running Level 4. What do you think will happen?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE_HINT1,Don't forget the semicolon at the end.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE_HINT2,"When it looks good, press the Flip button again and try your level.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and test your code by playing Level 4.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_PLAYTEST,Let's see those asteroids now.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_TOOMANY,"Leaping Antelopes! That's a LOT of asteroids. So many in fact that you blew up the limit.

It turns out the `spawnEnemy()` function gets called every tick (about 30 times per second!).

So you're creating 30 asteroids per second! Let's go back and fix it.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_NOENEMIES,Hmmm. I don't see any enemies yet. Let's go back and look at the spawn code again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2,"An asteroid every second is more like what we're going for. There are thirty ticks per second. 

We have a variable called `ticksSinceSpawn`, which goes up once every tick. Let's spawn it every 30 ticks.

See that line that says `if (ticksSinceSpawn > 0)`? That executes the line below whenever `ticksSinceSpawn` is greater than zero.

Let's change that 0 to 30 and we'll get one asteroid about every second.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT1,The condition would be `ticksSinceSpawn > 30`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT2,The code should be `if (ticksSinceSpawn > 30) { return asteroid; }`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT3,Go back to the game when you're ready and test it out.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_FINISHLEVEL,"Fantastic. Nice work spawning those asteroids! Now, go back in there and beat the level!",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_SUCCESS,Smart work there! Clearly you're ready for something more challenging. Stop by the Clubhouse for more.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_ABORT,Done so soon? Come back to the Clubhouse whenever you want to try again.,,,,
