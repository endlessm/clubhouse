GIMPPHOTO1_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In this activity, you'll learn to remove blemishes, adjust light exposure and color saturation, and crop a picture.",,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_1,Have you ever taken a picture and wished it looked a little better? It's time to learn how computers can improve your photos! We're going to use a program called GIMP. I'll open it for you.,daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_2,"So what's GIMP? It's a photo editing program with a ton of neat tools - a lot like Photoshop, if you've heard of that! Today, we're going to learn some of the basic tools that can make a big difference.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_3,"Let's open up our example photo. Go to File &lt; Open, and then, using the file browser that opens up, go to your <b>home</b> directory (it's got your username on it, on the left side of the file browser). Once you're there, navigate into your <b>Pictures</b> folder, then into <b>PhotoSources</b>, where you'll find <b>lower-face.jpg</b>. If you're asked to <b>Convert</b>, that's fine, go ahead.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_4,"Once we have the photo pulled up, we can start making changes. The first thing you might notice is that this person has some blemishes, or small unsightly marks. We're going to make them disappear! Look for a tool icon of two band-aids making an X. It's near the <b>bottom right</b> of the group of tool buttons that's in the <b>upper left</b> part of your screen. This is called the Healing Tool!",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_5,"Once you've clicked on it, you're ready to start using it. But this one is tricky, so don't just click on the blemish you want to erase. First, look below all the tool buttons for a slider named <b>Brush Size</b>. change it until your brush is closer to the size of the blemish you want to remove. You can adjust the size with the slider, or type a number.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_6,"Use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl+click</span></tt> to choose the location you'll copy from in image, like clear skin near the blemish. Then you can ""paint"" with the healing brush to paste that on top of the blemish. If your computer is running slowly, you might see a pink dot where you clicked last. Don't worry, that will go away once it finishes processing the change!",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_7,"And ya know, I usually use this technique when I want to make a nice photograph. But sometimes, I get a little silly and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl+click</span></tt> an odd area like hair or teeth. Try it and see what happens! Remember you can always <b>Undo</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu. When you're ready, we'll move on.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_8,"Next, let's talk about <b>exposure</b> - This is a way to control the amount of light and shadow in a picture. The longer the <b>exposure</b>, the lighter and brighter the image. The shorter it is, the more shadows you'll see. Why ""longer"" and ""shorter""? Because <b>exposure</b> is a word that comes from the world of film and cameras! It refers to how long the lens stays open to let light hit the film.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_9,"Use the menu bar at the top to select <b>Colors &gt; Exposure</b>. Now you can increase or decrease the amount of shadow, or Black, by dragging the slider left and right. Same thing for light, or <b>Exposure</b>. If you want to see half the photo unchanged for comparison, check the ""Split view"" box in the lower right.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_10,"As you may have noticed, the whole image is changed once you hit OK. The Reset button will undo the changes you've made and put the settings back to where they started.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_11,"Excellent! You've already made some noticeable changes to this photo. Now we're going to adjust it a little more, by tweaking the <b>color saturation</b>. This refers to how bright and vivid the colors are.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_12,"You've probably seen a photo with colors so bright they looked unnatural, or hurt your eyes - That picture was probably <b>oversaturated</b>. On the flip side, maybe you've seen a photo that looked washed out, or colorless - It was most likely <b>undersaturated</b>.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_13,"Use the menus to go to <b>Colors &gt; Saturation</b>. Try dragging the slider or clicking within the bar. You have the option for a Split view here as well. Any time you aren't sure what an adjustment slider does, it's a good idea to try both ends of it.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_14,"You may have already noticed this, but if you take the color saturation away completely, it's a black and white photo. This can be nice when you want a different look. All right, are you ready for the next one? You're doing great so far!",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_15,"Next, we're going to <b>crop</b> a photo, or cut some of the edges off to make it smaller. Before computers, we would have had to do this with a small sharp knife. And you couldn't undo any mistakes! Nowadays, we can use tools like these instead, which are a lot easier!",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_16,Select the <b>Crop</b> tool. It's near the top of the tool collection - It looks like a square with two corners overlapping.,daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_17,"Now, click and drag to create a box. The inside of the box will be the new photo, but don't worry if it didn't come out like you expected. You might notice that the rest of the photo still seems to be there, just a bit darker...",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_18,"That's because we haven't actually cropped it yet, we just told the computer where we <b>want</b> to crop it. We can change that by dragging the edges or corners of the box. If you move the mouse around inside that box, you'll see some boxes appearing.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_19,"These boxes show you where you can click to adjust the nearby edge or corner. With other programs, sometimes you have to get your mouse exactly on the outer line. That can be tricky for me, so I like way GIMP does it. Click and drag until you like the look of your picture!",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_20,"Now, you might have noticed that there's a tiny icon of a sharp knife next to your cursor now. Remember how they used to cut photos to size? That's a little throwback from our friends at GIMP. When you like the size and shape of your photo, you can press the enter key or click within your box.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_21,"The Crop Tool is really helpful if your photo has something you don't like on the edge, or you want to focus more on a specific part. You can even Crop someone out of the photo entirely! Just remember to use your powers for good. Now you're ready to save your photo and show it off to the world!",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO1_22,"Thanks for joining me! Next time you have a photo of your own that needs some ""retouching,"" you'll know how to fix it up yourself with GIMP!",daemon2,,,
