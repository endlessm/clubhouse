ONBOARDTOUR_QUEST_NAME,Endless OS Tour,,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_QUEST_SUBTITLE,Welcome to Endless OS!,,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Everything you need to get started with Endless OS is here - come on, dive in!",,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ABORT,"OK, we'll stop for now. If you ever need to get back you can find this quest in the <b>Clubhouse</b>!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_GREET1,"Hey there, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Welcome to Endless OS! First things first - Whenever you see a box like this, click the <b>❯</b> button to move to the next message.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_GREET2,"If you want to leave this tour, use the <b>X</b> button in the upper right of this text box. ",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_GREET3,"Also, if this text box gets in your way, you can move it to the bottom of the screen by clicking the little arrow button just above this text.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_Q_FIRSTCOMP,"Let's get going! Is this your first computer, <b>{{user_name}}</b>?",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ISFIRSTCOMP,Congratulations!,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_NOTFIRSTCOMP,"OK, you already know a thing or two, then. Great!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_Q_PREVOS,"Since you've used other computers before, do you want me to explain how Endless OS differs from other OSes, or do you just want the basics?",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_PREVIOUS,Tell me the differences!,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_FRESH,"Just the basics, please.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_Q_WHICHOS,"OK, I'll try and give you examples based on other computers you've used. Which kind were they? Pick the answer that has the most familliar logo.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_STARTFRESH,"We'll start fresh, then.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_WIN,Windows (Microsoft),ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_MAC,macOS (Apple),ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_PICKEDWIN,"Alright, I'll try to use examples from Windows to explain Endless OS.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_PICKEDMAC,"Alright, I'll try to use examples from macOS to explain Endless OS.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KBM1,"Since this is your first computer, we need to talk a little about the hardware, so that you'll understand later if a program or tutorial tells you to ""Press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> + <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt> + <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">P</span></tt> to open the command palette"", or something like that. ",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE1,"I know you've already figured out the basics of your mouse, since you're clicking on things on the screen! There are a few details and terms you should know, though.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE2,"The little arrow on the screen is called the <b>cursor</b> - so if any instructions talk about moving the cursor somewhere, that means move your mouse so that the arrow on the screen goes there.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_DESK1,"Your mouse usually has two buttons, <b>left</b> and <b>right</b>, and might also have a <b>scroll wheel</b> in the center.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_DESK2,"When something tells you to <b>click</b>, press the left mouse button down once. When something tells you to <b>right-click</b>, press the right mouse button. The right button is usually used for opening menus or lists of options.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_DESK3,"You can spin the wheel in the center of your mouse up and down to move the screen up and down when there's more than one screen of information in a program.
Some mice even let you press the wheel into the mouse and use it as a third button, known as the <b>middle mouse button</b>. It's rarely used, and your mouse might not have one.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_LAP1,Laptops usually have a <b>touchpad mouse</b> also just called a <b>touchpad</b>. It might or might not have buttons.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_LAP2,"If you don't have buttons foryour touchpad, <b>clicking</b> might mean tapping on the touchpad, pressing down on it, or touching a certain area. When something tells you to <b>right-click</b>, you might have to press down with two fingers at once on the touchpad, or press the side of the touchpad. There are a few different ways it could work, so be sure to read your computer's manual.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_LAP3,Some touchpads support swiping with two fingers to scroll windows up and down. Try yours out and see!,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB1,"Let's move on to the keyboard. You already know how to type all the normal keys, but in the future, you might need to type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + S</span></tt>, or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + (some other key)</span></tt>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB2,"When something asks you to type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + S</span></tt>, that means press and hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> (pronounced as ""Control""), then press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">S</span></tt>, then release both keys. You can hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> as long as you need to, but if you hold the other key for very long, it will repeat the command.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB3,"There are some other keys like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt>: There's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt>, and the key between <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt>, which is usually called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> or ""the <b>Windows</b> Key"". On most keyboards it looks like the <b>Windows</b> logo - A square made of 4 squares.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB4,"You can use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> to switch between apps, but I'll cover that more when we talk about apps.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB_LAP1,"Normally, the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">F Keys</span></tt> (<b>F1-F12</b>) on the top of your keyboard let you do laptop-specific tasks like turning your network connection on and off, adjusting screen brightness, volume, and more. Check the little pictures on them for a better idea of what they do.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB_LAP2,"Sometimes, though, you might need to use your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Fn</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Function</span></tt> key, in combination with those <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">F Keys</span></tt> (<b>F1-F12</b>) to do the special action. Check your computer's manual for more information, every computer is different.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB_DESK,"Your keyboard might also have a square pad on the far right with a lot of numbers on it - this is usually called the <b>numpad</b> or <b>number pad</b>. These keys will type numbers if <b>Num Lock</b> is on (look for a little light at the top of the keyboard), and will act as arrow keys or other keys if it's off.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KBM_MOVEON,"Now that you've got a handle on the hardware, let's move on.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_INTRO,"We'll begin our tour of Endless OS with what you're looking at now - This is called the <b>Desktop</b>, and it's made up of a few different parts.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_GRID,The first part is the <b>icon grid</b>. This is where all your <b>Apps</b> show up when you install them - it works a lot like your phone.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_GRID_MAC,"This isn't like the desktop on a Mac - You can't put files here, it's more like an extended <b>Dock</b>, or the <b>Launchpad</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_GRID_WIN,"This isn't like the Windows Desktop - You can't put files here, only Apps.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_SEARCH,"The next part is the <b>Search Bar</b>. It searches lots of different info - Your computer, the web, the <b>App Center</b>...",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_SEARCH_MAC,"On macOS, you might have used Spotlight to search your files - In Endless OS, you use the <b>Search Bar</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_SEARCH_WIN,"Like the <b>Start Menu</b> in Windows, you can use the <b>Search Bar</b> to find files and programs on your computer.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_PANEL,"The final part of the Desktop is the <b>Panel</b>. This is where you'll find system information like the clock, calendar, audio volume, and more. We'll go into more detail about the <b>Panel</b> later.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_PANEL_WIN,"Like in Windows, this is where you can find your open <b>Apps</b> and system information.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_PANEL_MAC,"This works mostly like the top bar in macOS, combined with the Dock's ability to see what programs are running.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS1,"Now that you know the basics of the <b>Desktop</b>, let's talk about <b>Apps</b>!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS2,"<b>Apps</b> are how you run programs on Endless OS, and you install them through the <b>App Center</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS3,Let's open the <b>App Center</b> right now. ,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS4,"You can search for <b>Apps</b> by name or keyword, using the <b>magnifying glass</b> icon in the upper left of the <b>App Center</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS4_MAC,The <b>App Center</b> works like the macOS <b>Applications folder</b> - you can use it to see what you have installed.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS4_WIN,"The <b>App Center</b> works like the Windows <b>Start Menu</b> and the <b>Add/Remove Programs</b> tool - you can use it to search for Apps to install, see what you have installed, and also remove Apps you don't want.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_Q_HASNET,"Because you're connected to the internet right now, we could do a quick walkthrough of installing an app. Does that sounds good?",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_A_YES,Sure!,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_A_NO,"Not now, thanks.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL1,"Great! OK, Click the <b>magnifying glass</b> in the upper left - the <b>Search</b> button.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL2,"Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Frozen Bubble</span></tt> into the search box - you should only get one result.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL3,"Click on <b>Frozen Bubble</b>, then click <b>Download</b>, and wait for the progress bar to fill.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL4,"There we go! <b>Frozen Bubble</b> is now installed - you could use <b>Launch</b> to start it from the <b>App Center</b>, or run it from the <b>Desktop</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL5,"You can play a few rounds now if you want, just press <b>❯</b> when you're ready to move on.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_NOINSTALL,"No problem, you can always open the <b>App Center</b> later and try on your own.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_NONET,"You can't install any new apps if you're not connected to the internet, but you can still use the <b>App Center</b> to check what's already installed for you to use.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_OPENWRITER,"Now, let's run an <b>App</b> - Find <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> on the <b>Desktop</b>, and click on it to launch it.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_TYPE,"Type some text - whatever you like, it's not important for this demo.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_TYPE_MOVEBOX,"Remember, if you need to move this text box, you can use click the little arrow right above the text to move it to the bottom of the screen.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILE,"Now, move your cursor into the upper-left part of the screen and click on the <b>File</b> menu.
Then, move your cursor down the menu to <b>Save</b>, and click that.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SAVEDIALOG,"A new window will pop up. Type whatever you like in the <b>Name</b> space at the top, then click the blue <b>Save</b> button, or press <b>Enter</b> on your keyboard. Don't worry about where you saved your file, yet - we'll get to that soon.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_CLOSE,"Now, let's close <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> by clicking the <b>X</b> in the upper right-hand corner of the <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> window. ",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_CLOSE_WIN,Closing a program works the same way in Endless OS and Windows - closing the window closes the program.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_CLOSE_MAC,"On a Mac, if you close a window, the program stays running. Here, on Endless OS, if you close the window, it closes the entire program.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPUSED,Great job! You successfully used an App!,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_OPENAPP,"Now, let's learn about <b>files</b> - open the <b>Files</b> App on the <b>Desktop</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_OPENED,"Here's where all your files will live! You've already got pre-made folders for <b>Documents</b>, <b>Music</b>, <b>Pictures</b>, <b>Videos</b>, and more.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_TRASH_WIN,"This is where the Recycle Bin is - It's called the <b>Trash</b>. It works the same way - you can recover files you've deleted, or empty it out.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_TRASH_MAC,"If you were wondering where the Trash is, it's here, in <b>Files</b>. It works the same way - you can recover files you've deleted, or empty it out.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_DOCS,"You might remember that when we saved our file in <b>LibreOffice Writer</b>, it went to a folder called <b>Documents</b>. 
You can go into <b>Documents</b> by finding it in the main part of the window and <b>double-clicking</b> it, or by looking on the left side of the window, and <b>clicking</b> on it in the sidebar.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_THEREITIS,Now that we're inside <b>Documents</b> - there's your file!,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_SAVEAS1,<b>Double-click</b> on the file to open it in <b>LibreOffice</b> again.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_SAVEAS2,"What if you wanted to save this file on a USB stick, or in a specfic place?",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_SAVEAS3,"Move your cursor into the upper-left part of the screen and click on the <b>File</b> menu.
Then, move your cursor down the menu to <b>Save As...</b>, and click that.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_SAVEAS4,"This looks a lot like the <b>Save</b> menu you just saw, but now it should look more familliar... It's very close to the <b>Files</b> window that you just used!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_SAVEAS5,"You can move to different places on the computer's hard drive using the left sidebar - if you had another USB stick plugged in, for example, that's where it would show up.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES_SAVEAS6,"OK, you can click <b>Cancel</b>, and close <b>LibreOffice</b> again, using the <b>X</b> in the upper-right.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SEARCH_INTRO,"There's another way you can find files, too. I'll take us back to the <b>Desktop</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SEARCH_NAME,Let's pretend you saved a file but didn't remember anything other than part of the name you used. This is where the <b>Search Bar</b> comes in handy. Type your file name in the <b>Search Bar</b>.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SEARCH_RESULTS,"Hopefully, you'll see just one entry in the results - that's your file! You might see more than one, but you can usually use the location below the name to figure out if it's the one you're looking for.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SEARCH_MORE,"You can search more than just files with the <b>Search Bar</b>, too. It can search the <b>Encyclopedia</b> App, and if you're connected to the internet, it can do a web search for you as well.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SEARCH_WEB1,"Since you're connected to the internet, let's try that out. Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">breadfruit</span></tt> into the Search Bar, then click <b>Search Google for ""breadfruit""</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SEARCH_WEB2,"Seems like it's a real thing, cool!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SWITCHAPPS1,"What if you have a couple different Apps open at the same time and want to switch between them? That can get a little confusing, but EOS has some great features to help.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SWITCHAPPS2,"First, you can look at the left side of the <b>panel</b>. The Endless button on the far left will immediately hide everything and take you to the <b>Desktop</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SWITCHAPPS3,"The keyboard can also help you get to the <b>Desktop</b> quickly. Press the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> key to show the desktop, and press it again to return to what you were doing. (Remember, the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> key has 4 squares on it, and it's near <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt>!)",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SWITCHAPPS4,"You can use the panel to switch between apps - The Apps that are open will show upon the left side of the <b>panel</b>, with little dots underneath their icons. You can click the icon to switch to an app.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SWITCHAPPS5,"You can also use the keyboard to switch between Apps. Hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> and tap <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Tab</span></tt> repeatedly to cycle through all the apps you have open - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt> + <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Tab</span></tt> does the same thing.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_Q_KNOWMORE,"Wow, I know this is all a lot! If you want to keep going, I have a few more things I can tell you about - but I understand if you're feeling a little overwhelmed.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_SOMEMORE,I'm up for a little more!,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_NOMORE,I'm OK for now.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_HACK,What's Hack?,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_HOW,How do I...,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_PROGRESS,❯,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_HOWDOI,&lt;Placeholder for howtos&gt;,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MORE_HACK1,"OK! You might have seen the <b>Hack</b> icon on the <b>Desktop</b>... Don't worry, your computer hasn't been hacked! ",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MORE_HACK2,"<b>Hack</b> is a toolkit where we guide you through learning a bunch of fun things - programming, 2d art, 3d modeling, music creation, web design, and more!
Some of Hack requires an active internet connection, but not all of it - each activity is marked by what it needs. Give it a shot!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_WHATSHACK,"Don't worry, your computer hasn't been hacked! ",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KEEPGOING,"OK, let's keep going!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS1,"Now, even though Endless OS is set up to work great by default, it can help to know just a little about its inner workings. Let's talk some more about the <b>Panel</b>, and the <b>Settings</b> window.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_TRAYICONS,Look in the bottom right corner of your screen - Do you see the icons to the left of the date and time? These icons are shortcuts for important information about your computer.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_MOVEWIN,"Also, if this text box is still in the bottom-right of the screen, you probably want to move it again - Just use the little arrow right on top of the first sentence, like last time!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_HASNET,"The icon on the left, the fan-shaped one, shows the strength of your connection to a Wi-Fi network - it's like the ""bars"" on your phone.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_NONET,"The left-most icon might look like a fan with a little X on it, or an airplane - either way, it means you're not connected to a Wi-Fi network.
(The airplane means ""airplane mode"" - all wireless connections turned off.)",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_TRAY_VOL,"The icon that looks like a little speaker gives you an idea of how loud your volume is. If you see a little X on it, that means your speakers or headphones are muted!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_LAP_BATT,"You'll also see a little icon that looks like a battery, and I think you can guess what that one means.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_TRAY_INFO,You can click on any of these icons to get more detailed information about them.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS8,"On the far right, in the corner, is a <b>circle</b>. It might have letters in it, it might be a picture, depending on what you did when you were setting up your user account in Endless OS.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS9,"<b>Click</b> that <b>circle</b>, and a menu will pop up. Then. <b>click</b> the entry in the menu named <b>Settings</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS10,"The <b>Settings</b> window is how you control all the details of how Endless OS works.
On the left side of the <b>Settings</b> window is a scrolling list of all the different categories of things you can change - But most of the time, you'll only need a couple.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS11,"You should see some of the more common categories without needing to scroll - <b>Wi-Fi</b>, <b>Background</b>, and <b>Power</b>.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS12,"<b>Wi-Fi</b> controls your network connection. You might use this if you're trying to connect to a specific network, turning <b>Wi-Fi</b> off to save battery, or trying to limit your data use because you're connected to network that charges you for data.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS13,"<b>Background</b> lets you set your desktop image to whatever you want. You can choose from a bunch of included images, or find your own.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS14,<b>Power</b> lets you change when and why your computer goes to sleep.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_LAP_PWR,"Because you have a laptop, you can have your power settings change depending on whether your computer is plugged in or not. Very handy!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS15,"Take a look at more categories in <b>Settings</b> if you want, but you shouldn't have to change anything. Endless OS is set up to work correctly, right out of the box.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_UPDATES1,There's one last category you need to know about - <b>Automatic Updates</b>.,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_UPDATES2,"Here the Endless OS Foundation, we're always working to improve Endless OS. We regularly release updates for free to all of our users - all you need is an internet connection to download them.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_UPDATES3,"Applications you install with the <b>App Center</b> are updated for free, as well.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_UPDATES4,"Normally, <b>Automatic Updates</b> are turned <b>on</b>. That means that if you're connected to the internet, the updates will download automatically, without you doing anything.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_UPDATES5,"If you're worried about how much data the updates use, this section has some options you can change - You can schedule when to install updates, change how they download, and change your network connection settings to help save data if you need to.",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ENDING1,"Congratulations! I know that was a lot, thanks for staying all the way to the end!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ENDING2,You now should know how to use Endless OS for most basic tasks!,ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ENDING3,"Explore all the apps that are already installed, and check out what you can do with them. There's a ton to do!",ada,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ENDING4,I hope you have fun with Endless OS - See you around!,ada,,,
