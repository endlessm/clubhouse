A glorious blank canvas! Nothing here except what we decide to `add`.

Let's make our own level. Go to the Level panel and write your own code, and beat it to finish!",,hurray,,

You can change both numbers. 0 to 4!",,,,

BONUSROUND_LEVELS10_B_HINT3,"Remember that the two numbers are x for column and y for row. 

`add (wall, 2, 4);` means add a *Wall*at x = 2 and y = 4. I usually just try different numbers or use graph paper.",,,,

See if your friend can beat your level!",,,,

Check out the little Gedit icon in the bottom left.",,,,

Then you go back in, figure out what's wrong, tweak some things, then try again. It's all part of it!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS2,Sweet! You nailed it! We should just be a few levels from finding that key! Fingers crossed. ,,hurray,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS2_B,"Now we have to beat _this_ level, and the *Units* panel is locked!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS2_B_HINT1,I'm worried about all those *Robots* in column 7. There's got to be a way to get rid of some of them.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS2_B_HINT2,We can still edit *Instructions*. We don't have to use the ones they gave us. Let's just try a different order first.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS3,"Nice, this level has no restrictions! We can edit *Units* and *Instructions* all we want.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS3_HINT1,"Wanna hear a real cool trick? When I get to column 4, all of the *Robots* will be back to where they started. 

Knowing that makes it easier to predict where the *Robots* in those last 3 columns will show up.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4,"Whoa, this level is _out of control_. And we can't edit *Instructions*! Challenging! We'll need to reorder them.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4_HINT1,"We can't edit *Instructions*, so probably all we can do is rearrange the ones we've got.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4_HINT2,"I think the last *Instruction*, in position 7, has to be a `jump`, since there's a *Pit* right near the Exit.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4_HINT3,"The first Instruction, in column 0, doesn't have to be an `up`. Something else could work there too.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4_HINT4,"If we `push` a *Wall* with a *Pit* to its right, the *Wall* will fall into the *Pit*. Love that! Let's make sure we use that.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4_HINT5,Just because we _can_ edit *Units* doesn't necessarily mean we _have_ to.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS5,"This level doesn't look too hard! But we can only reorder *Instructions*, not edit them.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS5_HINT1,"Hmm, `push` is a powerful *Instruction*, but it can't solve everything. Pushing a *Wall* isn't always the best option!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS5_HINT2,"`push` moves me forward. I can use it instead of a `forward` *Instruction*, even when I have nothing to `push` out of my way.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS5_HINT3,"I think we can tell what the final *Instruction* needs to be: `jump`. 

And to line up my `jump`, I somehow need to be right where that *Wall* is in column 6.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6,"You're really excellent at this. And persistent! Thanks to your help, we're almost there! I can sense the key ;) ",,hurray,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B,"Look at this weird level we have to beat. All the *Instructions* are missing! And the Units panel isn't even available, nice. ",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT1,We have to type all the *Instructions* in from scratch!,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT2,"Let's just try a solution, see how far we get, then tweak our solution based on what we observe, and then try again!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT3,"It's useful to remember that you can type *Instructions* in any order, then flip back over rearrange them.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT4,"I bet there's more than one way through this level. But pushing that middle block in column 2 seems like one approach. 

We may have to push it over and over.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7,"Oh cool, in this level we can use Unit editing AND *Instruction*  editing! It should be a breeze.

Wait, what? Are you seeing what I'm seeing? There's no way through a double thick column of *Walls*, is there? 

Not even `push` can solve THAT. What are we going to do?",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_B,Oh! Here it is! Guess what? I just found the Level Editing key! Just what we've been searching for! We did it!,,hurray,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_FLIP,"Flip the app around, then use the key to unlock the Level Editing panel!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE1,"Amazing! Exactly what I wanted! This is the code that creates this level!

See `add (pit, 1, 2);`? That's what creates the *Pit* right near the beginning. This code says: add a `pit` at coordinate (1,2).

Coordinate (1,2) means x = 1, y = 2. X is the column, so that's why the pit appears in column 1.

Y = 2 is for the row. The top row is y = 0, and the bottom row is y = 4. We hackers like to start counting from 0 instead of 1.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE2,"If we want to move that *Pit* out of our way, we can give it a new coordinate.

Try changing the coordinate to something like x = 1, y = 4 by editing the code to say `add (pit, 1, 4);`",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE3,"But we really need to do is fix the problem of two columns of *Walls* in a row! 

You know what's easiest? We can just delete some of them! Muah ha ha!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE3_HINT1,"See all the lines that say `add (wall, x, y);` and x is either 3 or 4? Those make all the *Walls* in columns 3 and 4. ",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE3_HINT2,Try deleting some of those lines to make it possible to finish the level. Then flip back to see how you did.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE3_HINT3,"Depending on how you edit the level, you MAY also need to edit *Instructions* so you can beat it.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS8,I LOVE editing the level! Remember how hard this robot dance party was? Now we can beat it EASY.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS8_HINT1,"Go the Level hacking panel and edit the code! Heck, you can just delete EVERY `add()` function if you want!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS8_HINT2,Don't delete `rileyPosition = 2;` and `goalPosition = 2;` though. You can always Reset the panel if you mess up.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS9,This out of control level got even MORE crowded. Madness! But edit the Level code and we'll finish it in no time.,,,,

So, we know that if you set some gravity on an object, it falls down, right? But what happens if you set the gravity negative? Try it!",,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_EXPLANATION_HINT1,Set the gravity for the orange ball negative.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_EXPLANATION_HINT2,Set species[0].gravity to -30.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_FLIP,Let's get in there. Press the Flip button.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_FLIP_HINT1,Pssst... press the big button on the left.,,,,

FIZZICSCODE2_LAUNCH_HINT1,Go to the desktop and click on Fizzics.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_QUESTION,Isn't the coding panel on Fizzics cool? Let's check out what we can do with it!,riley,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Let's do it!,,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_ABORT,We can do it later. Come find me at the Clubhouse whenever!,,,,

FIZZICSINTRO_END,"Oh, hey Riley! I hear you're already on Level 10!

See you back at the Clubhouse!",ada,,,quests/riley-theme
FIZZICSINTRO_EXPLANATION,"Fizzics helps me with my research on how things bounce, but frankly the slingshot is just really fun.

I can barely make levels fast enough for one of the students – she's already on Level 10!",,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_KEY,Excellent progress so far! I'm going to give you a reward.,,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_KEYAFTER,Your first key! This will come in handy later if you want to dig deeper into Fizzics.,,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_LAUNCH,"Fab, Go ahead and launch Fizzics now. ",,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_LAUNCH_HINT1,See the Fizzics app on the desktop? Click on it now to start the game.,,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_LEVEL1,"Okay, so first try to beat Level 1. Click around to check out how things work. ",,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_LEVEL1_HINT1,Click the orange ball to activate the slingshot. Pull back on it and then release it. ,,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_LEVEL1_HINT2,To win the level you have to fling all the orange balls against the goal.,,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_LEVEL2,"Clearly you've got the idea! Okay, so one more level to go.",,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_LEVEL2_HINT1,This works just like the others: get all the orange balls to the goal.,,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_QUESTION,"Oh hi again! By the way, I'm Ada. I'm working on my new game here in the Clubhouse. It's called Fizzics. Want to see it?",ada,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sounds fun!,,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_RAISEAPP,Bring up the Fizzics app. It's already running.,,,,

FIZZICSKEY_ABORT,"Come back when you're ready! Until then, Riley's stuck inside the maze! ",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LAUNCH,Launch Fizzics!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1,"Okay, so when I stashed the key in these early levels, Fizzics didn't even have a hacking panel.

So you're not going to be able to use some of the solutions you've used before. You'll have to improvise. 

it's fun to try out some clunkier solutions sometimes. Let's get started. It's easier to demonstrate than explain.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_B,"Right now this level is in suspended animation. It's been inactive for so long. 

Okay, so just let me make a few adjustments over here to get everything moving again. 

Ready?",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_C,"Okay! So that didn't work. We need get the orange ball to touch the goal, 

See how there's no *Fling* tool and no *Drag* tool? All you have is the *Add* tool. 

And you can only *Add* boulders! That's how ancient it is!",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_FAIL,"Hmmm... guess that configuration wasn't quite right. 

Nothing to do but try it again with a modified solution.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_FINISH,"Great job! You succeeded, even with a very limited set of tools.

Don't get TOO excited, though. We have a ways to go, still.",saniel,hurray,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_GO,Okay here we go!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q1,"Great, I'll take the level out of suspended animation. 

Just a couple more questions. What should the *Friction* on the orange ball be?",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q1_A1,Low.,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q1_A2,None!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q2,And how bouncy should the orange ball be?,saniel,,,

FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_READY,"Use the *Add* tool to *Add* boulders until you think the level is in a good configuration. 

Tell me when you're ready.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2,"Here's the next level. We have to get through all six!

This one is very much like the last, except the orange ball isn't bouncy.

I can control a couple things from here. I can make the orange ball and spikey things repel each other. 

And I can give the orange ball some friction.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_FAIL,"Curses! Well, let's try adding different boulders, or perhaps we can add different settings to the available parameters?",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_FINISH,Sensational! I'm pleased to see your skill and acumen at this task.,saniel,hurray,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_GO,Let's try it out!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_Q1,Do you want the the spiky balls to repel the orange balls?,saniel,,,

Tell me when you're ready.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3,"On this level, the orange ball can either have *positive* or *negative* *Gravity*. 

With negative *Gravity* intstead of dropping downwards, the ball floats upwards. 

Also note the two goals are overlapping. As soon as the level starts, they will fly away from each other!

Also, you'll see that the diamonds tend to clump together. That's because of their *Attraction* setting!",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_FAIL,"Blast. Well it's rare to get something right without trying a few times. 

So-called failure can be a great teacher! Let's attempt it again.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_FINISH,Aha! A worthy solution!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_GO,Let's try it out!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_Q1,Should the orange ball have positive or negative *Gravity*?,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_Q1_A1,Positive,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_Q1_A2,Negative,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_Q2,Also if you'd like I can make diamonds be repelled by boulders. That might be interesting.,saniel,,,

FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4,"This is another level in which the goal is mobile. That boulder is about to send it flying! 

Here's a nice thing though. All the diamonds are attracted to the orange ball! Very handy!

Let's see... I can increase the *Gravity* settings for the goal and the diamonds, if you'd like.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_FAIL,"What a bother. But no worries, let's try again.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_FINISH,You never fail to impress! Just two more levels to go!,saniel,hurray,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_GO,Let's see how that worked!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q1,Do you want the goal object to have any *Gravity*?,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q1_A1,Yes,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q1_A2,No,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q2,How about the diamonds. Do you want them to have gravity?,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q2_A1,Yes,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q2_A2,No,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q3,"Okay, hmm. These diamonds are bouncy. Do you want them to have friction?",saniel,,,

FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5,"This time the orange ball is all set to launch like a catapult! 

That should be fun. Watch out, though, it's VERY bouncy!

I can give the goal *Gravity* if you'd like. Hmmm look at this! I can also make the diamonds HUGE!",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_FAIL,Alas! Well it was an excellent attempt. Let's get back in and try again.,saniel,talk_anger,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_FINISH,"Nailed it! Excellent, we're ready for the final level! We'll recover that key soon enough!",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_GO,Here we go!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_Q1,Do you want the goal to have *Gravity*?,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_Q1_A1,Yes,saniel,,,

Tell me when you're ready.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6,"The key is here! We just need to beat the level! This one is peculiar however.

The goal has normal gravity. But the orange ball has NEGATIVE *Gravity*. 

I can increase its negative *Gravity* to cause it to fall upwards with greater force.

If you'd like, I can also cause boulders to repel the orange ball.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_FAIL,"This level seems quite the challenge. Don't fret, however. Let's just try again.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_GO,Let's hope this works!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_Q1,How much negative *Gravity* should the orange ball have?,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_Q1_A1,Some,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_Q1_A2,Lots!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_Q2,Should the orange ball be repelled by boulders?,saniel,,,

LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT,"So, here we are. See that number labeled *Cipher*, in the *Effects panel*? Try changing that and see what happens.",estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT2,"Aha! Look at the letters in the files. They've changed. They've also changed in *Cipher Output*, as well. Interesting!

This confirms my theory. This is encoded with a rotational cipher, where the letters are shifted over in the alphabet.

For example, if you take the word *CAT* and shift all the letters over one, you get *DBU*. ",estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT2_ADA,"Maybe the page holds some clues? What can we still see clearly? Just for fun, try counting the cat tails! ",ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3,"This looks like it might be a long, difficult process. Any tips, Estelle?",ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3_HINT1,"Ciphers like this one only change letters, not where letters appear in words. I think I see some patterns in the data.",estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3_HINT2,"Think about it. *OCZ* appears many times. 

So, if we compare *OCZ* to a common 3-letter word like *THE*, that will actually tell us alot!",estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3_HINT3,"Enter *OCZ* into *Cipher Input* and try different numbers until you get *THE* in *Cipher Output*. 

Solving the cipher for OCZ will help you solve the whole cipher!",estelle,,,

LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION2,"Tiiiiight! I knew you'd be able to help us with this, Estelle! Thank you!",faber,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION3,"Amazing. Thank you, Estelle. What does this new instruction do?",ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION4,"It does just what it says. You can use it to move a *Wall* that's blocking you.

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_PLAYING,"Okay, so let's see if those *spinners* can move vertically now.  ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_QUESTION,The new enemy in Lightspeed isn't working quite right. Can you help me out with it?,ada,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_QUEST_ACCEPT,I'd love to,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_SUCCESS,Perfect. Come back later and we can try some other cool ways to change the *spinner*,,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_ABORT,Check back if you want to explore the coding panel some more!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and play the level to test your code.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_ADD_ENEMY_CODE,Select the Spawn tab and make sure the `spawnEnemy` function creates a *spinner* enemy!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_ADD_ENEMY_CODE_HINT1,Make sure to return a `spinner` enemy in the `spawnEnemy` function!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_ADD_ENEMY_CODE_HINT2,Change the `spawnEnemy` function so it produces *spinner* enemies: `return spinner;`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE,"Select the Spinner tab and look for the `updateSpinner()` function.

Let's stop making `y` smaller when it becomes less than 0 (the bottom of the screen). Oh look, there's an `if` statement already.

Someone made it so `y` only gets smaller if the enemy's y position is less than 1000. That's not quite right. We call that a bug.

We don't want them going off the bottom of the screen, so let's only make `y` smaller when it is greater than 0.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT1,Now it's checking if `y` is less than 1000. Change it to more than 0.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT2,"Less than 100 is `< 1000`, so what would more than 0 would be?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT3,That's right: `> 0`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT4,So it should be `if (enemy.position.y > 0)` etc.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT5,Don't forget to play the level to check your results.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_END,"Here, take it. You can have it. You did a great job. See you around.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_EXPLANATION,"Now that *spinner* enemy moves in a diagonal and goes off screen. Let's make sure it stays on screen.

Let's go to the coding panel again.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_FINISHLEVEL,Excellent solution! Now they're not disappearing off the screen! Now go ahead and finish the level. ,,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_GOINGDOWN,Hmm. they're still going below the screen. Go back and make sure you don't update the y position if they go below 0.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_LAUNCH,You know the drill: Launch Lightspeed.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_NOENEMIES,Where did the enemies go? Go back to the Spawn tab and make sure to create some *spinner* enemies.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_NOTMOVING,Something went wrong and now the enemies aren't moving. Go back to the coding panel and let's fix it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_NOTREACHINGBOTTOM,The enemies aren't quite reaching the bottom of the screen. Check your code again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_PLAYING,Let's see how you did with that.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_QUESTION,Let's keep working on that Lightspeed enemy you made.,ada,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_QUEST_ACCEPT,"Okay, great.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_SUCCESS,"That's it. Beautiful work. 

By the way, you said earlier you were looking for a 
*ratchet wheel*. I knew I had one from an old project, and I found it for you!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_ABORT,"Okay, just check back later if you want to try some more coding. ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_ABOUTTOPLAY,"Now, go ahead and play the level. ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1,Here we are. Start by spawning `squid` in the `spawnEnemy()` function. Then play the level to test it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1_HINT1,Go to the Spawn tab and look for the `spawnEnemy()` function.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1_HINT2,You need to have a `return squid;` there.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1_HINT3,And play the level to check when you're ready.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2,"Click on the Squid tab and look for the `updateSquid()` function. We want them to move up and down randomly.

We can use the `random(a,b)` function that returns a number at random between a and b.

What could we do instead of always adding or subtracting a number to its `y` coordinate?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2_HINT1,Use the random function to give you a number between -20 and 20 for example.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2_HINT2,"That would be `random(-20,20)`.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2_HINT3,And add that to the current enemy `y` coordinate.,,,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_LAUNCH,Start by launching Lightspeed.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NOENEMY,Hmm That didn't quite work. We don't have any of that enemy in the level. Go back and try to fix it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NOTMOVING,"You got some *squids* all right, but they just go forward – maybe we can give them some better *squid* moves.

Let's write some code and see if we can get them to move up and down.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NOTMOVING_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_OFFSCREEN,The enemies are going offscreen. Go back and use the sin() function for their movement.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_PLAYTEST,Let's see if that worked.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_QUESTION,Perhaps you're ready to code a whole new enemy on your own?,saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_QUEST_ACCEPT,That sounds intriguing!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_SUCCESS,"Great! You can also choose different numbers in the `random()` function to get different results.

Go back and try later if you want to. But for now this is a great start. You just coded your first enemy from scratch!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_ABORT,Okay. Just check back later when you're ready to do some more work on Lightspeed!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_ABOUTTOPLAY,So here we are. Let's test the level!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab and look for the `spawnEnemy()` function as usual.

Whenever it's time to spawn an enemy make sure to return two kinds of enemies: *asteroid*, *spinner*, or *squid*.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT1,How do you pick one random number? That's right: the `random()` function.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT2,"And how do use it to pick one of two things? We could do `random(1,2)`.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT3,And all of that in an `if` statement to pick one enemy or the other.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT4,"So when it's time to spawn: 
`if (random(1,2) === 1) { return asteroid; }
return 'squid';`",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT5,All of that after `if (ticksSinceSpawn > 40) {...}` of course.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT6,Make sure you go back and test your code in the game!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_END,"I think you'll find this quite useful in your studies. It's amazing how many things call for hush rivets. 

You're always making things so I figured you could use some! ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_EXPLAIN,I'd like you to add the enemies for Level 7. But this time we should have *two* different kinds of enemies at once.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_EXPLAIN_HINT1,You should go to the code view as usual.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_FINISHLEVEL,Smart solution there! Now beat the level. ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_LAUNCH,Launch Lightspeed.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_NOENEMIES,Hmmm. No enemies at all! Are you sure you spawned some? Go back and check.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_PLAYING,Let's see if we get *two* types of enemies.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_QUESTION,Ready for your next coding assignment?,saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Of course!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_SOMENEMIES,We're missing some enemy types. Go back and make sure to spawn at least *two* types.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_SUCCESS,"Well done. I imagine you might be able to use
some *hush rivets*.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_ABORT,Oh! Come find me if you want to explore some more!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and play the level.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_CODE,Select the Spawn tab. Let's spawn a *beam* enemy in the `spawnEnemy()` function.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_CODE_HINT1,Just like we did before: `return beam;` in that function.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_CODE_HINT2,And go test it in the level.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_EXPLAIN,"OK, first let's spawn the enemy I started creating in Level 8. I call it the Beam. Let's go to the code.",,,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_SUCCESS,Well done! That's one super-hard enemy. LOL. We should fix it. Come get me whenever you want to try that.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ABORT,Check ya later!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Let's play now.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ADD_ENEMY_CODE,Select the Spawn tab and make sure the `spawnEnemy` function creates a *Beam* enemy!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ADD_ENEMY_CODE_HINT1,Make sure to return a `beam` enemy in the `spawnEnemy` function!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ADD_ENEMY_CODE_HINT2,Change the `spawnEnemy` function so it produces *Beam* enemies: `return beam;`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE,"Go to the Beam tab. Look at the `updateBeam()` function. This is different from the other enemies we've seen.

See those `if` statements? It's checking if `playerShip.position.y` is higher and moving up, or lower and moving down.

So it's tracking the player! Change the code so the enemy still moves some but it's easier to beat the level.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT1,What if we reverse the effect?,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT2,"So when the player is higher than the enemy, the enemy moves down and the other way around.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT3,"So instead of subtracting 5, add 5. Also flip the other statement.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT4,So `if (playerShip.position.y < enemy.position.y) enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 5;`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_EXPLAIN,"All right. So right now the *beam* moves towards the player relentlessly. It's impossible to beat.

Let's see if you can fix it so you can beat this level. Go to the coding panel.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_FAILED,"If that's too difficult, go back to the code and fix the enemy to make it move away from you.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_LAUNCH,"OK, guess which app to launch.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_LAUNCH_HINT1,Lightspeed! ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_MOVING,Cool. We got the enemies moving. Now try to beat the level. Let's see if you made it easy enough...,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_NOENEMIES,Weird. I don't see any enemies anymore. Did you change something? Let's fix it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_NOTMOVING,They're not moving at all. Something must be wrong. Let's check.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_PLAYTEST,Let's see if the enemies are moving correctly...,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_QUESTION,Should we make that new Lightspeed enemy a bit easier?,riley,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_SUCCESS,That's what I'm talking about! Great job!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_ABORT,"Go if you must, but I do hope you'll check back later.  ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_ABOUTTOPLAY,Ready. Let's play!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Click the trusty *Restart* button.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE,"All right, now we need to give it everything. Let's spawn every enemy and Power-up in this level.

Let's change it so it randomly spawns any of the 4 enemies: `asteroid`, `spinner`, `squid` or `beam`. I'm ready to give you hints.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE_HINT1,See where we return `asteroid`? Instead we'll return by using the `pickOne()` function.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE_HINT2,"Inside the `pickOne()` we will list the 4 enemies, `asteroid, spinner, squid, beam`.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE_HINT3,"So the whole thing should say `return pickOne(asteroid, spinner, squid, beam);`",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_END,This is auspicious indeed! I'm going to head to the Clubhouse and see how this work! See you there. ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_EXPLAIN,"Here we are. You'll have to create and beat the final level with every monster and every upgrade.

LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_ABORT,Stop by again sometime soon!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_ABOUTTOPLAY,"OK, let's try it now.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab. See the function called `spawnEnemy()`? That's where we create the asteroids.

There you can change the scale to something smaller so the level becomes playable again.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE_HINT1,See that `scale: 150`? Change that number to something smaller like 50.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE_HINT2,Make sure to play Level 3 and beat it to see if your solution works correctly.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION,Play Level 3 and be on the lookout for anything unusual.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION2,"Someone made those asteroids way too big! You'll need to get in there and adjust that. 

Just like before, you'll have to hack the app to fix it. But this time you'll be using code to do it.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION2_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_LAUNCH,"Most excellent. So as Ada told you, in Lightspeed you're going be able to add some new levels. 

But for now we've got an issue with Level 3 we'd like you to fix. Go ahead and launch Lightspeed now, please.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_PLAYTEST,"If that worked, the asteroids should be smaller. Can you beat this level?",,,,

LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Definitely.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_SUCCESS,Excellent. That'll do it. We've got a few more things to fix. Come find me when you're ready for more coding!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_ABORT,Done so soon? Come back to the Clubhouse whenever you want to try again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and test your code by playing Level 4.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab again. The `spawnEnemy()` function is returning null! No wonder there are no asteroids.

Try changing it to `return asteroid;` and running Level 4. What do you think will happen?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2,"An asteroid every second is more like what we're going for. There are thirty ticks per second. 

We have a variable called `ticksSinceSpawn`, which goes up once every tick. Let's spawn it every 30 ticks.

See that line that says `if (ticksSinceSpawn > 0)`? That executes the line below whenever `ticksSinceSpawn` is greater than zero.

Let's change that 0 to 30 and we'll get one asteroid about every second.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT1,The condition would be `ticksSinceSpawn > 30`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT2,The code should be `if (ticksSinceSpawn > 30) { return asteroid; }`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT3,Go back to the game when you're ready and test it out.,,,,

LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE_HINT2,"When it looks good, press the Flip button again and try your level.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_EXPLANATION,"Level 4 is somehow quite sparse! We could really use some more asteroids!

Go ahead and flip to hack just as we did before.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_FINISHLEVEL,"Fantastic. Nice work spawning those asteroids! Now, go back in there and beat the level!",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_LAUNCH,All right. Let's go to Lightspeed again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_NOENEMIES,Hmmm. I don't see any enemies yet. Let's go back and look at the spawn code again.,,,,

LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_TOOMANY,"Leaping Antelopes! That's a LOT of asteroids. So many in fact that you blew up the limit.

It turns out the `spawnEnemy()` function gets called every tick (about 30 times per second!).

LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_FIVE,5 more to go!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_GOAL,The goal of Lightspeed is very simple: Pick up 10 astronauts with your ship and avoid crashing into anything.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_LAUNCH,"We're all still heads down in this data corruption. Such a mess! Enough of that for now. 

You can help us by sharpening your coding skills! And this game will help you do that. it's called Lightspeed.

I'm going to give you the Lightspeed Controls Key. This will open up new coding options for you!",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_ABORT,No problem. Come back when you're ready.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LAUNCH,First let's launch *Lightspeed*.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click on the *Lightspeed* icon on the desktop.        ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS1,"A good strategy is just to try out each level first so you can see the nature of the challenge it poses.

Then when you flip to the *Toolbox*, I'll be standing by to help. Maybe we can improve this Squid situation!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS1_HINT1,Play this level and see what approach it requires. Then click the *Flip* button and get in there!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS2,"Good work! One level down, two to go! See what's up with this level. Then flip to hack.",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS2_HINT1,"Wow, the astronauts are tiny and they zoom super fast! Maybe a Power-Up can attract them?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS3,Last level! Almost there! The key waits for you when you win this level!,,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS3_HINT1,That's a whole lot of enemies! Maybe we can change how they Spawn.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELSINTRO,"The next three levels are OLD ones, so the challenges are weird! But the key we need is at the end.

Aaaand, some of the *Topics* aren't available! When you do see a *Topic*, jump on your chance to hack the level! ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_ASTEROID,The code in these *Topics* changes the behaviors of an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Asteroids.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_ASTEROID_HINT1,"Do you see where it says `enemy.position.y`? That tells the Asteroid where to be on the screen.

If `enemy.position.y` is 0, that's the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.

This code gets called every instant to tell the Asteroid what new screen position it should have.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_BEAM,The code in these *Topics*  changes the behaviors of an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Beams.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_BEAM_HINT1,"Do you see where it says `enemy.position.y`? That tells the Beam where to be on the screen.

If `enemy.position.y` is 0, that means it's at the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.

This code gets called every instant to tell the Beam what new screen position it should have.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_GAME,"You change the size of your ship and the astronauts in this *Topic*!

You can also change the speed and appearance of your ship.

This is a really handy *Topic*, because it has some other powerful parameters too.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_LOCKED,This *Topic* isn't available on this level!  How can you solve it with another *Topic*?,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS,"The code in this *Topic* changes what special powers you get when you collide with a Power-Up.

Power-Ups make it easier to pick up astronauts, or they can blow up enemies. Useful stuff like that!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS_HINT1,"Look for `if` statements, which check to see if something is either true or false.

For example `if (powerUpType === blowup)` tests to see if `powerUpType` equals blowup. It can be true or false.

`(powerUpType === blowup)` is called a condition. The code after it only happens if the condition is true.

For example, `if (powerUpType === blowup) blowUpEnemies();` means if the condition is true, then `blowUpEnemies();`",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS_HINT2,"One thing you could do is change which effect happens for each possible value of `powerUpType`.

`ship.attractTimer = 5;` is the code which makes the ship attract astronauts from further away.

You could replace the code that's called after each condition with that code.

As just ONE example, you could delete `ship.shrinkTimer = 5;` and replace it with `ship.attractTimer = 5;`.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS_HINT3,"You can shortcut conditions entirely by replacing them with `if (true)` or `if (false)`.

If you only want ONE kind of effect to happen, no matter which Power-up you hit, that's a way to do it.

You could replace every condition with `(true)` or `(false)`, depending on what you want to accomplish.

Don't be afraid if you mess things up. You can just hit the *reset all* button!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPAWN,"This is the Spawn *Topic*, and it controls when enemies and Power-Ups appear. It's really powerful!

Let's see, what kind of changes can you make here? ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPAWN_HINT1,"See where it says `return` and then an enemy type like `asteroid`? That's the type of enemy that gets spawned.

So you could change the word after `return` to change which enemy type appears.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPAWN_HINT2,"Or sometimes, you'll see an `if` statement, which checks to see if something's true or not.

For example `if (r === 2) return spinner;` tests to see if r equals 2, and if it does, that's true, so it `return`s spinner. 

The part that says `(r === 2)` is called the _condition_. You could change it, like `if (r ===` some other number maybe.

Or you can just change it to say `if (true)` or `if (false)` which will automatically pass or fail the condition test.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPINNER,The code in these *Topics*  changes the behaviors of an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Spinners.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPINNER_HINT1,"Do you see where it says `enemy.position.y`? That tells the Spinner where to be on the screen.

If `enemy.position.y` is 0, that's the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.

This code gets called every instant to tell the Spinner what new screen position it should have.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID,"The code in these *Topics* creates behaviors for an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Squids.

If you're having problems with Squid enemies, maybe you can fix it here.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT1,"Do you see where it says `enemy.position.y`? That tells the Squid where to be on the screen.

If `enemy.position.y` is 0, that's the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT2,"This code gets called every instant to tell the Squid what new screen position it should have.

If it says `enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 0;` that means set the new position to the current position.

It actually says `+ 0` but when you add zero to something the number doesn't change.

And with no change, the Squid's position stays the same as it was.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT3,"So you can tell every Squid where to be on the screen every instant! What can you do with that?

They would move upwards with `enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 5;` or a higher number than 5.

Or you could just set their position to a fixed number with NO changes like `enemy.position.y = 500;`",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_QUESTION,Ready to go get that key from Lightspeed?,faber,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_QUEST_ACCEPT,Can't wait. Let's go!,,,,
