HTMLINTRO1_1,"Hi, *{{user_name}}*! I know you've used the internet before - but have you ever wondered what goes into showing you all those web pages?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_10,"You put HTML around text, and that tells your web browser what to show, and how to show it on your screen. Not so bad, right?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_11,"In HTML, everything with *<* and *>* around it is called a *tag*. Tags tell the browser how to display something - text, images, whatever.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_12,"Tags usually come in pairs - an *<opening tag>*, and a *</closing tag>*, like saying *start* and *stop*",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_13,"Let's get our hands dirty! Find the text *Hello, World!* on the page, and change it. Add you name, your favorite food, whatever you like.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_14,"Awesome! You just edited a webpage, so that makes you a web designer!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_15,"Let's take it one step further - see the *<p>*, *<h1>* and *<h2>* tags in the code? Try changing the text between some of those tags...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_2,"I was wondering that, one day, and I decided to go find out. There was a ton to learn, but now that I've done the legwork, I can pass it on to you.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_3,"Before I explain anything, let's get you looking at the guts of a web page.",riley,,,

HTMLINTRO2_11,I wonder what happens if you try the same logic with an *<h1>* or *<h2>* tag? Try making one of those purple.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_12,"If you did it right, it should look something like *<h1 style=""color:purple"">*.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_13,Nice. But what if you wanted to use that shade of green that grass gets when it's almost summer but not quite?,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_14,"That's probably not a color your web browser understands, so we need a more specific way to express color.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_15,"Fortunately, your web brower understands something called *hex color* - a way of expressing color using 6-digit numbers.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_16,Here's an example hex color - *#76EECF*,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_17,"Notice the letters in there - Hex color uses 1 to 9, then A B C D E F. Think of it as a way of getting 2 digit numbers without using 2 digits.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_18,"The 3 groups of 2 numbers express how much red, green, and blue you need to make that color.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_19,"*#76EECF* means some red, *lots* of green, and a good amount of blue..",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_2,First things first - let's get back to that web page previewer.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_20,"To use a hex color in your webpage, just replace one of your color words with a hex code - try *#76EECF*!",riley,,,

HTMLINTRO2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Take your HTML knowledge to the next level by learning about web colors.,,,,
HTMLINTRO2_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
HTMLINTRO3_1,"Last time, we figured out HTML colors, but you're probably wondering if you can change text in other ways.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_10,"You can also use italics (I can't, I'm jealous!) - put `<i>` and `</i>` around some text.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_11,You can even combine bold and italics - just put both sets of tags around the same text.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_12,"Now let's try some sizes - These work like colors, so they go into the `<p>` tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_13,"Try `<p style=""font-size:200%"">` on a paragraph.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_14,"See how that's similar to what we did with colors? We're adding another 'style' to the text, but this one talks about size.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_15,"You can also use words like *xx-large* and *small* for `font-size`, instead of percentages.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_16,Here's something cool - setting the font size is just adding a style on the the `<p>` tag... so you can combine it with colors!,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_17,"Try `<p style=""font-size:200%; color:red"">` You use a semicolon (;) to separate additional styles.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_18,"I take back what I said earlier - now *THAT* pops. Remember, you can also stick these styles on `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and so on.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_19,"Now that you know how to make text look different, how about adding an image?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_2,"*Yes, you can.* I mean, I've been doing it this whole time!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_20,"To show an image: `<img src=""http://www.w3schools.com/html/img_chania.jpg"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_21,"You can read the first part as *image source*. The next part is where the image is located - for this, on another website.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_22,"While we're here, think about the way that tag is written. Does that look familliar?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_23,Think back to `p style`. Look at the way these two tags are laid out:,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_24,"`<img src=""https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_chania.jpg"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_25,"`<p style=""color:red"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_26,"One's longer, but do you see how the way they're written is the same? HTML has consistent rules that you can learn, like any language. ",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_27,"If you can master the rules of HTML, you'll be able to use any tag in existence!",riley,,,

HTMLINTRO3_6,"You'll notice that there's more text this time, so let's make the first paragraph stand out! Add the tags `<b>` and `</b>` around the first sentence.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_7,"Bold! People usually put the first `<b>` tag after the opening `<p>` tag, but it's not required.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_8,"BTW, that nonsense text we're using is called as *lorem ipsum*.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_9,"*Lorem ipsum* goes all the way back to the 1500s. It was originally from some ancient Greek speech... Saniel knows more, I'll ask him sometime.",riley,,,

HTMLINTRO4_10,"Let's give it a shot - inside the `<style>` tag, type `p { color:purple; }`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_11,"Remember, the semicolon (;) lets us separate 'instructions' for styling.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_12,"Now that we've got some kickin' purple text, let's make it bigger.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_13,Add `font-size: x-large;` right after the color instruction. Don't forget a space!,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_14,Nice. Now *that's* got my attention.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_15,"You can do this for other tags, too - Use the name of the tag, an open brace ({), your styling, and then a closing brace (}).",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_16,Let's try `h1` - that'd be `h1 { color:red; }`,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_17,"Great job! So, do you see how easy this can be, now?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_18,It doesn't matter if you have an entire novel in that web page - it'll all be exactly as you say in the `<style>` tag.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_19,"There's still another level to climb to, though - What if I told you that you could make up your own tags?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_2,"Well, here it is - there's a way to automate all those ""color="" and ""font-size="" bits.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_3,"It's called CSS, and it's pretty awesome. Let's get rolling.",riley,,,

HTMLINTRO4_5,Or clicking the link - https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/vYYyNba?editors=1000,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_6,You should notice a new section inside the `<head>` tag - `<style>`,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_7,"Remember how we changed text colors, before? We used `style=""color:green""` inside a tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_8,"This is essentially just taking all of that manual work, and centralizing it, like a set of rules.",riley,,,

OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_10,"Right now, yours should say `~` (tilde), which means we're in your `home` directory, where all your stuff is.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_11,"So what's a *file system*? Bascially it's like a big group of folders, and some of them contain more folders inside them, and so on...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_12,"You might also hear these folders called *directories*, sometimes.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_13,"To see what's around you in the current directory, you use `ls` (that's lower-case L, lower-case S)",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_14,`ls` is a command that *lists* everything in the directory you're in. It's like looking around in a room.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_15,Type `ls` into the Terminal then hit *Enter*.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_16,"Cool! That should have shown you a list of items, then given you a new prompt.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_17,"Whenever you see a new, empty prompt, the Terminal is ready for another command.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_18,"So, if you have already saved any files in your home directory, you'll see them here.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_19,"Wait, did you create a directory named `yarnbasket`? What's that doing here?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_2,"The Terminal is mondo cool, it's where the REAL magic in the OS happens. You know those scenes in movies where they hack into computer systems?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_20,Let's check it out. To go into another folder (or directory) we need to use the `cd` command.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_21,"`cd` stands for *change directory*. You need to tell `cd` where to go - so let's type `cd yarnbasket`, then hit *enter*",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_22,"Your prompt should change - It should say `yarnbasket`, since you typed in `cd yarnbasket`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_23,"Now that you're inside this folder, type `ls` again to see what's inside.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_24,"Is that a file named.... *mouse*? Ew, Felix!",riley,,,

OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_28,"Well, if Felix won't help us, we'll just have to use a different cat.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_29,"The program `cat` helps you open files - it shows their data on the screen, right in the terminal.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_3,"That's *supposed* to look like the Terminal. I'm going to teach you the *real* stuff, though!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_30,You can actually `cat` any file - but only text files will be anything you can read. ,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_31,Let's check out that file - type `cat mouse` to `cat` the file named *mouse*.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_32,LOL! Looks like Felix played one of his pranks on us... Just like a real cat.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_33,"That was fun! You learned *ls*, *cd*, and *cat* - and I've got much more planned for next time!",riley,hurray,,

OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_4,"Just a couple things before we start - when I do text like *this*, it's important.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_5,Text `like this` is a command - something you could type into the terminal.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_6,So if I say *don't* type `destroyallfiles`... hehehe.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_7,Let's get started - I'll open the Terminal open for you.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_8,"Nice. See that text on the left there? That's called the *prompt* - it's `your user name`, @, `your computer name`.",riley,,,

OSONESHOTFOLLOW_10,"I feel like a pirate digging up buried treasure. Yarr, matey! Avast!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_11,"Like any pirate, we need to get our loot back onto the ship - or, in your case, your home directory.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_12,"To move a file, we need to use the *move* command... `mv`. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_13,"`mv` needs the file you want to move, and where you want it to go.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_14,Let's tell `mv` to move this file by directly telling it where to move to.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_15,"So, that's `mv treasure.jpg ∼/Pictures/`...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_16,... Move `treasure.jpg` into `∼/Pictures`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_17,"Great job! If you're wondering how I know all the ways to use these commands, it's because there's a manual you can read!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_18,"There's a command you can use called `man` - you do `man` and then any other command, and it'll tell you how to use it.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_19,"So, for example, try `man mv`. Press `q` to quit the manual when you're done.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_2,"If you're not in `yarnbasket`, let's get back in there - `cd yarnbasket`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_3,"Let's look at your results from last time - if you forgot the file you saved, do `ls` and try to find it.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_4,Now you can `cat results` (or whatever you named your file).,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_5,"Like I said last time, this looks like a list of directories. Let's follow the trail...",riley,,,

OSONESHOTMAP_11,It's a little program called `grep` - Ada told me to think of it like a little monster that sifts through files.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_12,"`grep` is like `cat`- it needs a file to work on. Unlike `cat`, it also needs something to look for.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_13,"Let's try a quick example - use `grep` to look for ""cat"" in `mouse`, the file from last time.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_14,"`grep`, then the thing we want it to look for, then the file we want to look in - so, `grep cat mouse`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_15,"And there we go. One line comes back, because that's the only line where ""cat"" shows up.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_16,"That works, but what if there's a lot of results? We might want to save it in a file, so we can look at it later.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_17,"To get `grep` to save its output, we use `>`. That tells `grep` ""Send your result over there ->"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_18,"On the other side of the `>`, we put the name of the file we want to use. So let's combine that with the last thing we did...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_19,"`grep cat mouse > myfile` - Find ""cat"" in `mouse` and save it in `myfile`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_2,"Ok, that was kinda corny, but I'm getting a big kick out of this. I hope you're having fun too!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_20,Now you can `cat myfile`... and you should see the same thing you saw when you ran `grep` the first time!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_21,We're almost there - is your brain all tangled up yet? I hope *knot*! :D,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_22,"The last piece of our puzzle is a tough one - we've used `grep`, but so far we've had to tell it what to look for.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_23,"We know that `treasuremeowp` has a ton of ""meow"" in it, but we want everything that *isn't* that.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_24,"Good thing `grep` has an option we can use to help! `-v`, for *invert*. It takes what we ask for and gives back everything *else* instead.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_25,"These options go right after `grep`, but before the search text or file name - like setting a drill to forward or reverse, first.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_26,Let's try that on our old standby - `grep -v cat mouse`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_27,"See? We got all the lines *except* the ones with ""cat"". Are you ready for the final step?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_28,"Try to figure it out yourself first - we want to `grep`, inverted (`-v`), looking for ""meow"", in `treasuremeowp`, sending it to a file.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_29,"Got it? If your brain feels like it's sweating, you're doing great!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_3,"Last time, we `cat`ed a ""mouse"" into the terminal. That's cool, but there was another file I wanted to look at.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_30,"All together, that's `grep -v meow treasuremeowp > results`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_31,"Now the moment of truth - hit *enter*. If you see nothing, that means no errors... then you can `cat results` to see what we got.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_32,Whoo. I think my brain needs a sports drink...,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_33,Hmm... another puzzle! Those forward-slashes might mean this is a list of directories...,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_34,"I was right! This *was* a treasure map, and it's leading us deeper into the file system!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTMAP_4,"So, check your prompt - are you still in `yarnbasket`? If not, let's `cd yarnbasket` to get in there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_5,"...And now, let's `ls` to see what we've got.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_6,See that file named `treasuremeowp`? That was what I was looking for - it's got treasure in the name!,riley,,,
