INTRO_QUESTION,Hi there! Glad you’re here  =^._.^=   Ready to do some more exploring?,riley,,,
INTRO_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,,quests/quest2-riley-hi
INTRO_WELCOME,Hi {{user_name}}! Welcome to the Clubhouse!,ada,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_FLIPBACK,Nice hack!,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_FLIPBACK_HINT1,I wonder if anything happened to the gate? Click the Flip to Hack button again.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL,Beautiful! All new students must solve this puzzle.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL_HINT1,Match it by moving the sliders and the doors will unlock.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL_HINT2,Keep trying! Move the sliders until the gold wave fits into the groove. ,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_WELCOME,How do you open a locked gate with no key?,ada  ,,quests/ada-intro,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_WELCOME_HINT1,What's that button on the left?,,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_1,"What a ride! We decoded a hidden message, followed a treasure map, and walked away with pirate's booty!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_2,This wouldn't be complete without a way to show off your prize - and I've done a little digging to figure out how.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_3,"Let's get to where we stored your prize - `cd Pictures`, then `ls` to make sure the file's there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_4,"Great! Let's get this on your screen, now.",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_5,"Look down in the bottom right of the screen, and click your user picture. From that popup menu, click `Settings`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_6,The `Settings` app is where all the internals of the OS are controlled. Look on the left side of the window and click `Background`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_7,"... and from here, click `Background`, and then the `Pictures` tab. Your treasure should show up!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_8,"Just double-click it, and that'll set it as your background.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_9,"Check it out! Now you've got an brand-new desktop background - anyone asks where you got it, you send 'em to me!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_END,"Thanks for letting me teach you some cool stuff, {{user_name}} - I had a lot of fun doing it. Keep an eye out for more!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_LAUNCH,Pop the Terminal open and let's get to it.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_1,Hey {{user_name}}! Ada's always saying we should search out new things to do - so I want to try teaching you some tricks in the *Terminal*!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_10,`ls` is a command that *l*ist*s* all the files and folders in the directory you're in.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_11,"Huh, this is your `home` directory.. but do you remember creating a directory named ""yarnbasket""?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_12,Let's check it out. Type `cd yarnbasket` to *c*hange *d*irectory into it. It's just like double-clicking a folder in the File Manager.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_13,"Now that you're here, type `ls` again to see what's inside.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_14,Ew. Is that a file named.... `mouse`? Felix!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_15,"_Nyan, brrrp? Miao&~^w!_",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_16,"`<Felix licks his nose, and vanishes into an air duct.>`",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_17,"Well, if that cat won't help us, let's use our own - Type `cat mouse`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_18,"LOL! Well, yeah, I should have expected something like that.

`cat` reads the contents of a file into your terminal window, so that's what was in the file. You win this round, Felix.",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_2,"The Terminal is mondo cool, it's where the REAL magic in the OS happens. You know all those scenes in movies where they're hacking into computer systems?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_3,"Yeah, those lines of green text are supposed to look like the Terminal. I'm going to teach you the *real* stuff, though!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_4,Let's get started - I'll pop the Terminal open for you.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_5,"Nice. See that text on the left there? That's called the *prompt* - it's `your user name`, @, `your computer name`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_6,"This means that this terminal is logged into your account, on your computer. But what's after the `:`?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_7,"After the colon (:) is where you are in the filesystem. `~` means your `home` directory, where all your stuff is.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_8,"Now that we know where we are, let's see what's here. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_9,Type `ls` into the Terminal then hit *Enter*.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_END,"Whew, that was fun! You learned *ls*, *cd*, and *cat* - and I've got more planned for next time!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_1,"I'm so excited, we're on the trail of something cool, I know it. Let's take another look at that map.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_10,"To move a file, we need to use the *m*o*v*e command... `mv`. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_11,"Like *grep*, *mv* needs some extra info - It needs the file you want move, then the place you want to move it.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_12,So... `mv treasure.png ∼/Pictures/` That moves it into your Pictures folder. (`∼` means your home directory),riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_2,Do `cat savedresult` (or whatever you named your file last time).,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_3,"Like I said, this looks like a list of directories. Let's follow the trail...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_4,"You can do this 2 ways - either do `cd <the first directory>`, `cd <the second directory>` and so on, or...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_5,"... you can string them together - `cd all/strung/together/like/this`. Your choice, they'll both get us where we want to go.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_6,"Now that you're at the end, let's `ls`...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_7,Sweet! Treasure.png! We found it!,riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_8,"Haha! I feel like a pirate digging up buried treasure. Yarr, matey! Avast!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_9,"Like any pirate, we need to get our loot back onto the ship - or, in your case, your home directory.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_END,"Great job! For the final lesson, I have something special planned...",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_LAUNCH,Open up the Terminal and let's roll out!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_1,"Ready to dive back into the Terminal? I hope so, because there's no brakes on this knowledge train, woo woo!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_10,"There's one last trick, though - see, normally, `grep` looks for a group of letters, but we actually want everything that's NOT those letters. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_11,"So we have to add `-v`, for in*v*ert - that tells `grep` to look for stuff that's NOT the letters we put in.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_12,"Whew! Complicated! Let's put it together - don't hit enter until the very end. `grep`, the command, `-v` to invert...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_13,"`meow`, the word that we want to remove, `treasuremeowp`, the file we're working on...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_14,"...Then `> savedresult` so we can save the result into whatever you want to name the file. I'm going to call it `savedresult`, though.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_15,"All together, that's `grep -v meow treasuremeowp > savedresult`. Are you sweating? I think my brain needs a sports drink...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_16,"Now the moment of truth - hit *enter*. If you see nothing, that means no errors... then you can `cat savedresult` to see what we got.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_17,"Interesting. Those forward-slashes mean this is a list of directories. It WAS a treasure map, and it's leading us into the file system!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTMAP_2,"Ok, that was kinda corny, but I'm getting a big kick out of this. I hope you're having fun too!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_3,"Last time, we `cat`ed a ""mouse"" into the terminal. That's cool, but there was another file I wanted to look at in `yarnbasket`. So, `cd yarnbasket` to change directory...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_4,"...And as usual, `ls` to see what we've got in here.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_5,There we go  - I was interested in `treasuremeowp` - it's got treasure in the name! Let's read it - `cat treasuremeowp`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_6,"Ok, so that's totally unreadable. Reminds me a lot of my last big essay after Felix was done with it... But! Ada gave me a tip after that happened.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_7,"She told me that if I ever want to search a file to find words, I can use `grep`. It's a program that goes through files and finds a group of letters.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_8,"But normally, `grep` just does its work and then finishes. If we want to see what it did, we need to tell it to save its work.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_9,"To get `grep` to save its output, we use `>` - that tells `grep` ""Send your result over here -->"". Then we add a filename, and that saves the result!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_END,We'll tackle that path in the next part - I'm excited to see what we'll find!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_LAUNCH,Launch the Terminal and let's get going!,riley,,,
QUICKSTART_END1,Feel free to come back if you need a refresher.,daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_END2,"Wow, look at the time! I have to get back to my `crontab` - I have some scheduled tasks to start...",daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_HACKSWITCH,"OK, first off, use the *top buttons* to navigate back to the main Clubhouse view.

You can use that big switch in the *bottom right* to turn Hack Mode on and off .

Off, you're essentially using a normal computer. On, we get busy and let you hack programs. Simple!",daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_NEGATIVE,👎,daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_PATHWAYS1,"*Up top*, there's the Pathways button. If you already know what kind of activities you want to do, go here.",daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_PATHWAYS2,"If you'd prefer to see what everyone in the Clubhouse might offer you, talk to them instead.",daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_POSITIVE,👍,daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_PROFILE1,Your profile's in the upper left. You can change your name and profile picture using the Endless OS `Settings`.,daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_PROFILE2,"To get directly to that section, click the picture way down in the far bottom right of your screen.. 

...and then click the bigger version of that picture that shows up in the popup menu.",daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_PROFILE3,"Otherwise, you can use the Desktop search bar to open `Settings`, go into the `Details` section, and then into the `Users` section.",daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_WELCOME1,"Hi! My name's `cron`, and I'm a Daemon! We're the guys who run around behind the scenes making sure everything in the OS is working.",daemon,,,
QUICKSTART_WELCOME2,Ada asked me to run you through the Clubhouse's functions. Sound good?,daemon,,,
