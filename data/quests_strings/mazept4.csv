MAZEPT4_QUESTION,"Ready to get back in to the Sidetrack app and help Riley escape, once and for all?",Ada,,,
MAZEPT4_QUEST_ACCEPT,Let's do it!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT4_LAUNCH,Let's launch *Sidetrack*.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT4_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click the *Sidetrack* icon. ,Ada,,,
MAZEPT4_FLIP,"That key you and Saniel recovered from *Fizzics* will unlock Unit editing. 

That's how Riley will get past this level.",,,,
MAZEPT4_FLIP_HINT1,Press the *Flip* button on *Sidetrack* so we can see *Sidetrack's Toolbox*.,,,,
MAZEPT4_UNITS,"Look at that. With this panel, we can edit ""Units"" which in this case means *Robots*!

We can change which way the *Robots* face!",,,,
MAZEPT4_UNITS_HINT1,"The difficulty in this level is that the *Robots* are always in the way. 

But if you flip which direction they face from DOWN to UP, Riley will be able to get past them!",,,,
MAZEPT4_UNITS_HINT2,"Set *Robot* Type A to UP. You might also need to change *Instructions* while you're hacking. 

Then flip back around and press Play.",,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS2,"I remember this level. It used to be so hard! But now I can edit *Instructions*. 

And I have `push`, and I can even edit *Units* to change both *Robot* types. This should be a breeze!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS3,"Don't forget when you edit *Units*, you can change the direction of BOTH robot types.  

That's sometimes necessary.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS3_FABER,Hello Saniel. Glad to see you’re back. How was your nap? Any discoveries?,Faber,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS3_ADA,"Saniel, Faber and I have a few questions for you.",Ada,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS3_SANIEL,They'll have to wait till later! Riley's almost all the way through the maze!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS4,"Hey guys. I caught sight of the AI. It was just a flash. I always just manage to see part of it!

It brushed past me in that last level. I'm not seeing it now, but I know it's around somewhere. ",Riley,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_LEVELS4_SANIEL,"Okay, let's be very careful in this level. The AI is probably tracking you closely, Riley.  

It's imperative that we keep this AI contained! ",Saniel,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_LEVELS5,"Huge bummer! All the *Instructions* in this level are missing! 

You'll need to type the *Instructions* yourself from scratch.",Faber,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_LEVELS5_RILEY,"That AI-whatever */\‿/\* 
is right behind *∫∫* me. 

I think it's following me*/ᐠ｡｡ᐟ\*!",Riley,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_LEVELS5_SANIEL,"Okay, Riley. We're tracking you super closely now. This is the level that's going to finally lead to the outside! 

When you reach that *Exit*, you're going to need to jump clear! Don't look back now, Riley!",Saniel,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_END1,We did it! Riley's out! Hooray! Amazing work everyone!,Ada,,,quests/ep4end3
MAZEPT4_END2,"So relieved to see all of you! That was quite an adventure! 

I'm so grateful for all your help in getting me out of there! 

But something tells me it wasn't just me that jumped out! ",Riley,,,quests/ep4end3
MAZEPT4_END3,"We're so relieved to see you, Riley! And I think you may be right. I did see something flash by. 

I see it all too clearly now. This whole thing — It's all connected — this whole maze situation, Ada's missing files — 

All this chaos around the Conservatory was all part of the AI's scheme to escape!",Saniel,,,quests/ep4end4
MAZEPT4_END4,"Whatever it is, it must be pretty smart if it outsmarted all of us!",Riley,,,quests/ep4end4
MAZEPT4_SUCCESS,"I understand your admiration, to a degree, Riley, It learns incredibly fast. That's exactly what it does.  

And I do believe it played us, Riley. But we're _onto_ it now. 

The whole Conservatory is going to need to be on high alert with an AI on the loose! 

I'm counting on you, Riley, to keep your sharp eye out for any unusual activity. ",Saniel,,,quests/ep4end5
MAZEPT4_ABORT,"Okay, but come back to help as soon as you can!",Ada,,,
