P5JSVARINTRO2_QUEST_NAME,P5JS - Variables and random()!,,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In part 2 of this activity, you'll use variables with random() to generate random colors!",,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_1,"Welcome back, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! I'm super excited to show you how to create random colors using variables!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_2,"Let's start up the online editor for <b>p5.js</b> - If it doesn't open automatically, click this link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4""><a href=""https://editor.p5js.org/"">https://editor.p5js.org/</a></span></u>",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_3,"Now let's get this sketch started by creating our <b>variables</b> for our random colors!
",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_4,"For this sketch we will create our <b>variables</b> inside the curly braces ( <b>{}</b> ) for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>. When you put <b>variables</b> inside the curly braces ( <b>{}</b> ) of a piece of code, they only work in there, nowhere else. So, for example, if you made some <b>variables</b> in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt>, you couldn't use them in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>.
",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_5,"If you wanted all the code to be able to use your <b>variables</b>, you'd put them up at the top, like you might have done in the previous activity. Then they'd be <b>global variables</b>!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_6,"Oh! One last thing I wanted to share with you before we create our <b>variables</b>. Our sketch will be using something called <b>RGB color</b>. This means that every color we use will be described by how much red, blue, and green is in it.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_7,"The numbers for red, green, and blue go from 0-255. For example, to create purple, you could set red to 255, green to 0, and blue to 255. That'd be a very bright purple!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_8,"Now, let's get those <b>variables</b> in. Start by creating a new line below <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background(220)</span></tt>, and typing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">r = random(0, 100);</span></tt>",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_9,"The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">random()</span></tt> <b>function</b> takes the 2 numbers you give it, and finds a random number between them. So, we told <b>random()</b> to pick a number between 0 and 100 for the <b>variable</b> <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">r</span></tt>.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_10,"Now, let's get the other 2 <b>variables</b> we need. Make 2 new lines below the line with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">r</span></tt> on it, and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">g = random(100, 200);</span></tt> and then type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">b = random(200, 255);</span></tt> on the third line.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_11,"Great work so far! Now, if we put all 3 of those <b>variables</b> together, we'll get a color with a decent amount of red, a large amount of blue, and a very large amount of green. Every time <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> runs, the color will change. Let's make a square so we can see it in action.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_12,"First, though, we need to set the color that we want our square to use. We'll use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill()</span></tt> - but this time, we need to tell it what color to use with our new variables. Make another new line below the line with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">b</span></tt>, and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill(r, g, b);</span></tt> on it. It's that simple!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_13,"Next, make <b>another</b> new line below the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill</span></tt> line, and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">rect(mouseX, mouseY, 20, 20);</span></tt> on that line. Then, you can press <b>Play</b>, and check out the colors!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_14,"Like the last actvity, we still have a black outline on our square, so let's change it! Do you remember what <b>function</b> we used to set the outline color last time?",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_15,"Yep, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke()</span></tt>! Make a new line between <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill(...</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">rect(...</span></tt>, and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke(r, g, b);</span></tt> on it. Press <b>Play</b> and see what happens.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_16,"Now, the whole square is all one color, because we're using the same <b>variables</b> for the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke()</span></tt> and the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill()</span></tt>. Every time <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> happens, it runs <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">random()</span></tt> once for each of your <b>variables</b> - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">r</span></tt>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">g</span></tt>, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">b</span></tt>. Until <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> finishes, it won't run <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">random()</span></tt> again, so the numbers will be the same every time you use them. That's why the inside and outside of the square are the same color, even though you're using <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">r</span></tt>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">g</span></tt>, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">b</span></tt> twice!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_17,"Go ahead and take some time to experiment with your new creation! Maybe, you can change the ranges of  <b>random()</b>? Just remember the colors have a 0-255 range. You could also create some new <b>variables</b> and give them different <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">random()</span></tt> values, so you could create 2 fully random colors. Use one for the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill()</span></tt> and the other for the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke()</span></tt> and see what you get!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_18,"If you created an account, you can save your work now. If not, no big deal, you can always come back and do this one again if you want to impress your friends or parents!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO2_19,"For our next activity, we'll take this sketch to the next level and learn how to make it interactive - you'll be able to have it react to when your mouse is clicked. See you next time!",daemon3,,,
