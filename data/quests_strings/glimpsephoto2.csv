GLIMPSEPHOTO2_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In this activity, you'll learn to use a bunch of tools in GIMP that can massively change how a photo looks!",,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_1,"Hi there! Ever wanted to make a cool art photo with neat digital effects? If you weren't sure how, today is the day to learn a few cool techniques. I'll open up GIMP, and we can get started.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_2,"First, pick a photo to edit. If you don't have one, you can search the web or look at Wikipedia articles. Try to find a photo of a person to start with - later, you can use photos of anything! Once you find a good picture, make sure you save it to your folder.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_3,"To open your photo, go to <b>File &gt; Open</b>. Then, using the file browser that opens up, go to your <b>home</b> directory (it's got your username on it, on the left side of the file browser). Once you're there, navigate into your <b>Downloads</b> folder and select the picture you just downloaded.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_4,"Today I'm going to share some of my favorite ways to change the look! First, on the top menu, select <b>Colors &gt; Posterize</b> (it's near the bottom of the list). Adjust the ""Posterize levels"" to find what looks best to you. If you want to go back to the default level of Posterize, click 'Reset.' When it's just right, click 'OK.' Can you imagine a thematic word along the bottom of your image?",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_5,"If you think this looks cool and you want to save it, we're going to use a special kind of Save called <b>Save As...</b> This makes a copy of the original document and lets us edit the name before saving it to the hard drive. Go to <b>File &gt; Save As</b>...",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_6,"After you give it a name and hit the <b>Save</b> button, GIMP will save this version of the picture. But what happens to the old version without changes? It's still there! Try going to <b>File &gt; Open</b>... and select the old version to reopen it. You should find it in the same location as when we started.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_7,"Ready for another tool? After each one, you always have the option to <b>Save As</b>. If you don't like it, close the window and reopen the original file. Once you have the original version pulled up, you're ready for the next edit.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_8,"Go to <b>Colors &gt; Colorize</b> (it's also near the bottom). It turns your photo to a vibrant color! You can adjust which one by clicking inside the Color box at the bottom. Don't be afraid to experiment with the sliders and see how they affect things. There are different ways to adjust these sliders, so I'll explain your options.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_9,"When you adjust sliders, you have choices for how to do it. If the cursor is in the top half of a slider, it looks like an up arrow. If you click when it looks this way, the slider will jump to wherever your mouse is. When the cursor is in the bottom half of a slider, click and then type a number. You can also use the small arrows on the right of each bar. Try it all, and find what you like!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_10,"Use the ""Split view"" option to see before/after.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_11,"Now, if you like it, go to <b>File &gt; Save As</b>... and give it a cool name. Once you do that, use <b>File &gt; Open</b> to select your base image again and open it.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_12,"Now try <b>Colors &gt; Desaturate &gt; Color to Gray</b>. It might take a minute, but GIMP will show you a black-and-white version of your photo. If you click 'Enhance Shadows' you might find that it looks like almost like a pencil drawing. But what about those sliders?",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_13,"The 'Radius' slider tells the computer how far around a pixel to look before deciding what color this area is. GIMP uses this info to choose a shade of gray, or <b>gray value</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_14,"We'll come back to the 'Samples' slider and jump to 'Iterations'. This tells GIMP how many times to work on each group of pixels when it's deciding the gray-value. Have you ever tried to solve a math problem by estimating, and then redoing your estimates to get closer and closer to the correct answer? That's what this is.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_15,"The more 'iterations' you use, the harder it is for your computer's brain, the <b>Central Processing Unit</b> (or <b>CPU</b>). But the result might be worth it! Your final picture will look a lot smoother and more realistic with less <b>noise</b>. When a picture looks grainy, almost like sand's been spilled, we say it has a lot of <b>noise</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_16,Now for the 'Samples' slider! This one is similar to 'Iterations' - it helps GIMP get a more accurate reading on what the color is. This helps get an accurate <b>gray value</b> that looks right for the photo. Try moving the different sliders and see how the results change!,daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_17,"Now, as you try to move the sliders, you might notice that sometimes they do different things. When the cursor is in the bottom half of a slider, it shows two arrow, pointing in opposite directions. If you click while it looks like this, you can type a number in for that value.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_18,"Remember to <b>Save As</b> and <b>Open</b> a base version again if you need to, because next we'll make it look like an old cowboy photograph!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_19,"Go to <b>Colors &gt; Desaturate &gt; Sepia</b>. You can use the slider for ""Effect strength"" to control how much color is drained out. At very low levels, it's hard to notice and looks almost like sunlight. At the highest level, it is very yellow-brown. This color is called <b>sepia</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_20,"Again, <b>Save As</b> and <b>Open</b> the base version if you need to. Now I'm gonna show you one of the neatest tools ever! We're going to change the <b>perspective</b> of the photo to make it look like we're viewing it from a different angle!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_21,"Look for the <b>Handle Transform Tool</b>. It's near the middle right, and it looks kind of like a sheet of paper being moved, and it has arrows on the sides. It's right next to the icon of a hollow cube. Hover the cursor over different Tools to see their names.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_22,"Okay, this tool uses <b>handles</b> to move the picture around. Try clicking on the photo and dragging it. You've created the first <b>handle</b>! When you drag it around, the picture moves. Keep using that same <b>handle</b> though, and don't click anywhere else on the pic.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_23,"If you dragged it too far away, use the <b>Reset</b> button in the dialog box that popped up. <b>Reset</b> will go back to where you started and erase all <b>handles</b>. You can also use <b>Cancel</b> to exit this tool and go back to how it was. If you decide you like a change, hit <b>Transform</b> to make it stay.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_24,"When you're ready, try clicking somewhere else on the picture to add a second <b>handle</b>. Now if you drag, you'll notice the picture rotates and you can even adjust the size. This is because you can control two perspective points with two <b>handles</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_25,"Remember, you can use <b>Reset</b> or <b>Cancel</b> if you mess up, and <b>Transform</b> to make your edit stick. Ready for things to get crazy? We're going to add a third <b>handle</b>. I'll give you some more info...",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_26,"With 3 handles, you can make it look like the photo is being moved in 3D. If you hover over the circle for a <b>handle</b> it expands so you can click inside to drag it. Click outside a circle and you make a new <b>handle</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_27,"Remember, if you get confused or if you don't like it you can always <b>Reset</b>. If you hit <b>Transform</b> and then change your mind, just use <b>Undo</b> (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl+z</span></tt>).",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_28,"Once again, use <b>Save As...</b> to save your masterpiece, and you'll still have your original photo. If you use <b>Save</b> instead, it will update the original photo to what you've created.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_29,Try some more tools and find new ways to turn photos into masterpieces! You can find all sorts of interesting stuff in the menus and the <b>Tool Collection</b>. Hover over things like <b>Tools</b> to get more information. Don't be afraid to try something and then <b>Undo</b>!,daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_30,"I love exploring a new art program like this, just trying different things to see what they do. It's my favorite way to discover new tools for my next work of art. I hope you have fun experimenting. See you next time!",daemon2,,,
