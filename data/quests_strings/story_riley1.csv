STORY_RILEY1_1,"RILEY: Hi! I knew we were getting a new student at the Academy, as part of that new program, but I didn't know that was, like, now!

I'm Riley, and I am sooo excited to have you here! I was part of some advanced program-thing, and there's nobody my age around, so…",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_2,"Anyway! You're here! I have to show you SO MANY things, this place is amazing.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_3,"I, uh, don't want to pry, but… what's up with your avatar? It's like you're not really here, or something.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_4,"There you are! I'm not surprised that you found each other already - I can tell you two are going to be great together.

Riley, this is our remote student, {{user_name}}. They're on a very limited-fidelity link- remember your networking lessons?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_5,"Oh, so they can't answer me?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_6,"They can, but only with 1 bit - so, yes or no only. Right?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_6_RPOS,See?,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_6_RNEG1,*snort*,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_6_RNEG2,Your sense of humor certainly matches hers. I see some joint pranks in your future…,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_7,"Saniel does always say I talk enough to cover for the students that don't… actually, what he says is:

""Riley, have you been altering the acoustics of my classroom again? Every time I detect several voices, they're all yours.*

*That's quite a trick… but this is History of Algorithms, not Ventriloquism.""*",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_8,That's quite an impression of Dr. Rowe.,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_9,"It is, isn't it? I'm glad to hear that at least something of my demeanor seems to be rubbing off on her.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_10,"Saniel! Uh, hi.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_11,"I'm an easy target, Riley, and I know it. Now, if you really wanted to make someone jump, you could work on mimicing Dr. Hart.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_12,"Estelle? She's a tough one, I can't ever seem to find her.

I'll be looking all over and hear from someone that she was in the Observatory, then Faber will tell me he just ran into her near Admin...

...And then someone else will say she's in the Library… it's like she moves at light speed around this place!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_13,And just when you think you'll never find her and stop…,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_14,"I know, right? She'll pop up right next to you! I want to learn how to do THAT.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_15,"You'd no doubt spend the first week or so trying to see how far you could make us jump in fright.

Then again, you would always be on time to class, I suppose. Perhaps it's worth the trade?",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_16,"Aw, come on, that was only one week!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_17,"Don't worry, Riley, Dr. Rowe still won't let me hold any more of our wax cylinder collection.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_18,"That was a priceless artifact from the 19th century, you know.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_19,"We had just finished making a duplicate, and one of the cats jumped onto my shoulders!",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_20,"Well, yes, but it's the principle of the thing. At least the data is still safe. And the cats.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_21,That really IS the most important part.,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_22,"In the end, yes. Life is the most precious thing of all. Speaking of which, Riley, could you come help me feed the cats, please?",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_23,"RILEY: Sure thing, Dr. Rowe! I gotta run, {{user_name}}, but it was great to meet you! I can't wait to see the fun things we'll do in the future.",riley,,,
