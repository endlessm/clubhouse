LIGHTSPEEDKEY_QUESTION,Ready to go get that key from Lightspeed?,faber,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_QUEST_ACCEPT,Can't wait. Let's go!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LAUNCH,First let's launch *Lightspeed*.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click on the *Lightspeed* icon on the desktop.        ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELSINTRO,"The next three levels are OLD ones, so the challenges are weird! But the key we need is at the end.

Aaaand, some of the *Topics* aren't available! When you do see a *Topic*, jump on your chance to hack the level! ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS1,"A good strategy is just to try out each level first so you can see the nature of the challenge it poses.

Then when you flip to the *Toolbox*, I'll be standing by to help. Maybe we can improve this Squid situation!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS1_HINT1,Play this level and see what approach it requires. Then click the *Flip* button and get in there!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS2,"Good work! One level down, two to go! See what's up with this level. Then flip to hack.",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS2_HINT1,"Wow, the astronauts are tiny and they zoom super fast! Maybe a Power-Up can attract them?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS3,Last level! Almost there! The key waits for you when you win this level!,,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS3_HINT1,That's a whole lot of enemies! Maybe we can change how they Spawn.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_LOCKED,This *Topic* isn't available on this level!  How can you solve it with another *Topic*?,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_GAME,"You change the size of your ship and the astronauts in this *Topic*!

You can also change the speed and appearance of your ship.

This is a really handy *Topic*, because it has some other powerful parameters too.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPAWN,"This is the Spawn *Topic*, and it controls when enemies and Power-Ups appear. It's really powerful!

Let's see, what kind of changes can you make here? ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPAWN_HINT1,"See where it says `return` and then an enemy type like `asteroid`? That's the type of enemy that gets spawned.

So you could change the word after `return` to change which enemy type appears.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPAWN_HINT2,"Or sometimes, you'll see an `if` statement, which checks to see if something's true or not.

For example `if (r === 2) return 'spinner';` tests to see if r equals 2, and if it does, that's true, so it `return`s spinner. 

The part that says `(r === 2)` is called the _condition_. You could change it, like `if (r ===` some other number maybe.

Or you can just change it to say `if (true)` or `if (false)` which will automatically pass or fail the condition test.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_ASTEROID,The code in these *Topics* changes the behaviors of an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Asteroids.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_ASTEROID_HINT1,"Do you see where it says `enemy.position.y`? That tells the Asteroid where to be on the screen.

If `enemy.position.y` is 0, that's the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.

This code gets called every instant to tell the Asteroid what new screen position it should have.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPINNER,The code in these *Topics*  changes the behaviors of an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Spinners.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPINNER_HINT1,"Do you see where it says `enemy.position.y`? That tells the Spinner where to be on the screen.

If `enemy.position.y` is 0, that's the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.

This code gets called every instant to tell the Spinner what new screen position it should have.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID,"The code in these *Topics* creates behaviors for an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Squids.

If you're having problems with Squid enemies, maybe you can fix it here.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT1,"Do you see where it says `enemy.position.y`? That tells the Squid where to be on the screen.

If `enemy.position.y` is 0, that's the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT2,"This code gets called every instant to tell the Squid what new screen position it should have.

If it says `enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 0;` that means set the new position to the current position.

It actually says `+ 0` but when you add zero to something the number doesn't change.

And with no change, the Squid's position stays the same as it was.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT3,"So you can tell every Squid where to be on the screen every instant! What can you do with that?

They would move upwards with `enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 5;` or a higher number than 5.

Or you could just set their position to a fixed number with NO changes like `enemy.position.y = 500;`",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_BEAM,The code in these *Topics*  changes the behaviors of an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Beams.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_BEAM_HINT1,"Do you see where it says `enemy.position.y`? That tells the Beam where to be on the screen.

If `enemy.position.y` is 0, that means it's at the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.

This code gets called every instant to tell the Beam what new screen position it should have.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS,"The code in this *Topic* changes what special powers you get when you collide with a Power-Up.

Power-Ups make it easier to pick up astronauts, or they can blow up enemies. Useful stuff like that!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS_HINT1,"Look for `if` statements, which check to see if something is either true or false.

For example `if (powerUpType === 'blowup')` tests to see if `powerUpType` equals blowup. It can be true or false.

`(powerUpType === 'blowup')` is called a condition. The code after it only happens if the condition is true.

For example, `if (powerUpType === 'blowup') blowUpEnemies();` means if the condition is true, then `blowUpEnemies();`",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS_HINT2,"One thing you could do is change which effect happens for each possible value of `powerUpType`.

`ship.attractTimer = 5;` is the code which makes the ship attract astronauts from further away.

You could replace the code that's called after each condition with that code.

As just ONE example, you could delete `ship.shrinkTimer = 5;` and replace it with `ship.attractTimer = 5;`.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS_HINT3,"You can shortcut conditions entirely by replacing them with `if (true)` or `if (false)`.

If you only want ONE kind of effect to happen, no matter which Power-up you hit, that's a way to do it.

You could replace every condition with `(true)` or `(false)`, depending on what you want to accomplish.

Don't be afraid if you mess things up. You can just hit the *reset all* button!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_SUCCESS,"Such skillful work getting through those levels! 

And excellent work getting that key! We can use that back in *Sidetrack*!",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_ABORT,No problem. Come back when you're ready.,,,,
