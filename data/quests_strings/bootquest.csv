BOOTQUEST_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
BOOTQUEST_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn to use Bootstrap, one of the fastest and most popular web libraries out there!",,,,
BOOTQUEST_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! You've been doing some great website work so far - but I'm sure you've wondered if there was a <b>really</b> fast way to build a website.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_2,"Well, there is! There's lots of code out there in these big collections called <b>libraries</b>- grab one of those, and you've got a ton of basic (and sometimes advanced!) functions and pieces already figured out for you. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_3,"<b>Bootstrap</b> is one of the most popular <b>libraries</b> out there, and since the code has all been used and reused thousands of times, it has barely any bugs. That's a big weight off your shoulders!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_4,"Let's jump right into creating a website with Bootstrap. If your browser doesn't open, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://codepen.io/Hack-Computer/pen/ExamVOm</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_5,"You might recognize CodePen from some of your previous activities in the Web Pathway. This time, though, we're starting with a (relatively) blank canvas.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_6,"If you look at the <b>CSS</b> and <b>JS</b> panes, you can click the <b>gear</b> icon at the top of each of those panes to see that we've already <b>imported</b> some code for you. This is how you use a library - you <b>import</b> it. It's like referring to a character that was introduced earlier on in a book series. ""If you want to know more about Jeff, read the previous book.""",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_7,"In that same way, all the bits that make up <b>Bootstrap</b> are referred to in the library we <b>imported</b>, and you can just refer to them and have them work.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_8,"This lets <b>Bootstrap</b> do all the heavy lifting, which frees you up to concentrate on the overall design of the website.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_9,"Let's take a look at the Bootstrap components you'll be using for the project. I'll launch another tab on your browser. If another tab doesn't appear, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_10,"These <b>Components</b> are all included in <b>Bootstrap</b>, all you have to do is reference them and they'll show up in their full glory, like the heroic ranger the author introduced 5 chapters ago that rides in to save the day!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_11,"Let's add a <b>Carousel</b> to your page - lots of websites have these, it's that big image at the top that changes every so often. Click on the <b>Carousel</b> link in the left-hand section of the page, then find the section called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">With controls</span></tt>. Just under the image, youâ€™ll see a bit of code with a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">copy</span></tt> link at the top right corner.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_12,Click the link to copy the code and paste it onto line 11 of your Codepen.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_13,"You won't notice a huge change because the carousel doesn't have any pictures to display, but we're about to fix that.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_14,"Find the first of the three <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt> tags. To the right of img, replace the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">...</span></tt> with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u>""</span></tt>. Don't forget to keep the quotation marks. :)",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_15,"The line should look like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img src=""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u>"" class=""d-block w-100"" alt=""...""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_16,"Boom, the carousel appeared with an image. Great job!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_17,"Now do the same thing for the other two <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt> tags using <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/catpicture1</span></u></span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/gingy</span></u></span></tt>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_18,Awesome! Now your carousel will rotate between three images.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_19,Let's try adding a <b>Jumbotron</b> component to your page - This component lets you show off a bit of text in a really big way!,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_20,"As before, look on the left of the Bootstrap page and find the <b>Jumbotron</b> section. Click it, then scroll down in the main part of the page until you find the <b>Fluid Jumbotron</b>. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_21,"Click the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Copy</span></tt> link at the top right corner and paste the code just under your carousel on line 37 of your Codepen.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_22,"Awesome! If you did it correctly, you should see the same block that was displayed on the Bootstrap page just under your carousel. Cool, right?",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_23,Nice job on the <b>Jumbotron</b> and <b>Carousel</b>! Let's keep going and add some more information to your page in the form of some cards. Cards are a great way to provide a lot of information in a small space.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_24,"First, though, add an empty line between lines 42 and 43 of your CodePen. We'll need that space!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_25,"Head back to the Bootstrap library page, and find the <b>Card</b> section in the left pane. Click it, and then scroll down in the main part of the page until you find <b>Card decks</b> section. Grab that code, and paste it into line 43.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_26,"Like the <b>Carousel</b>, it'll show up with broken images at first - don't worry, we'll fix that. Find the first <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""...""</span></tt> section and replace it with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u>""</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_27,"Sweet! You're getting the hang of this! Try using the same image for the other two <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""...""</span></tt> sections as well.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_28,"Great job! Now, you can try using even more and different Bootstrap components to add more content to you site and personalize it. Make it your own!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_29,"You did it! You've learned how to create a website using Bootstrap, which... you guessed it, levels you up as a Web Developer! Now, let's show off your hard work. Click on the <b>Change View</b> button at the top right corner of your CodePen and select <b>Full Page View</b>. Next, take a screenshot of your awesome work by pressing the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">prt sc</span></tt> (print screen) button on your keyboard - it'll be at the top.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_30,"Nice, that'll save an image in your <b>Pictures` folder. You can find it by going to your desktop, then clicking on *Documents</b>, and then the Pictures icon on the left side of the window. Finally, you can share your pic on social media and tag us using #MadeToHack!",daemon,,,
