BOOTQUEST_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
BOOTQUEST_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn to use Bootstrap, one of the fastest and most popular web libraries out there!",,,,
BOOTQUEST_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! You've been doing some great website work so far - but I'm sure you've wondered if there was a <b>really</b> fast way to build a website.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_2,"Well, there is! There's lots of code out there in these big collections called <b>libraries</b>- grab one of those, and you've got a ton of basic (and sometimes advanced!) functions and pieces already figured out for you. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_3,"We've already hooked up all the Bootstrap bits for you - it's going to do all the heavy lifting so you can concentrate on designing the website. Let's take a look at the toolbox you'll use. If your browser doesn’t open, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_4,"These <b>Components</b> are all included in <b>Bootstrap</b>. All you have to do is paste some code into your webpage, and then they'll show up in their full glory.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_5,"Ok, let's get started on your webpage. If your browser doesn’t open, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://codepen.io/Hack-Computer/pen/ExamVOm</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_6,You're already familiar with Codepen - let's add some Bootstrap bits to the site.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_7,"Let's add a <b>Carousel</b> to your page - lots of websites have these, it's that big image at the top that changes every so often. On the left side of the Bootstrap Components page, there's a scrolling section - Click on the <b>Carousel</b> link, it's the 7th down from the top. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_8,"In the center section, under the <b>Carousel</b> heading, find the section called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">With controls</span></tt>. Just under the image, you’ll see a bit of code with a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">copy</span></tt> link at the top right corner. Click the link to copy the code.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_9,"Go back to your CodePen, and paste that code (Ctrl + V) onto <b>line 10</b> of the HTML pane. You won't notice a huge change in the preview, because we haven't set up any images yet. Let's do that now.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_10,"In the HTML pane, find the first <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">img src=""...""</span></tt> section and replace the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">...</span></tt> with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u></span></tt> Don't forget to keep the quotation marks. :) The line should look like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img src=""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u>"" class=""d-block w-100"" alt=""...""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_11,"Boom, the <b>Carousel</b> appeared with an image. Great job! Now do the same thing for the other two <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt> tags using <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/catpicture1</span></u></span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/gingie</span></u></span></tt>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_12,Awesome! Now your <b>Carousel</b> will rotate between three images.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_13,"Let's try adding another Bootstrap Component to your page - Let's use a <b>Jumbotron</b>, and show off some text in a big way!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_14,"Like we did for the <b>Carousel</b>, find the <b>Jumbotron</b> section on the left-hand side of the Bootstrap Components page. Click it, then scroll down in the main part of the page until you find the <b>Fluid Jumbotron</b>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_15,"Underneath the <b>Fluid Jumbotron</b> text, you'll see another <b>Copy</b> link inside a grey block of code. Click the <b>Copy</b> link to copy the code. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_16,"Go back to your CodePen, and paste that code (Ctrl + V) under the <b>Carousel</b> code, on <b>line 34</b>. You should now see the same block that was displayed on the Bootstrap page just under your carousel. Cool, right?",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_17,"Awesome! Nice job on the <b>Jumbotron</b> and <b>Carousel</b>, your site is beginning to look professional! Let's keep it going, and add one last Bootstrap Component - A card deck!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_18,"Head back to the Bootstrap Components page on Chrome, and find the <b>Card</b> section on the left-hand side. Click <b>Cards</b>, then look on the right side of the page, and find <b>Card Decks</b>. Click that text to jump right to that section.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_19,"Now that you're looking at the <b>Card Decks</b>, find the grey code box, and click the <b>Copy</b> link to copy the code. Go back to your CodePen, and paste that code (Ctrl + V) under the <b>Fluid Jumbotron</b> code, on <b>line 41</b>. Don't worry if it looks odd; we'll fix that in a minute.",,,,
BOOTQUEST_20,"Like the <b>Carousel</b>, the <b>Card Deck</b> will show up with no images at first, so let's add some. Find the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">img src=""...""</span></tt> sections and replace the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">...</span></tt> with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u></span></tt>",,,,
BOOTQUEST_21,"You did it! By completing this activity, you learned how to create a website using Bootstrap. You're a Web Designer! If you would like to save your work, ask for your parent's permission to create a Codepen account.",,,,
BOOTQUEST2_QUEST_NAME,Bootstrap Like a Web Developer,,,,
BOOTQUEST2_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
BOOTQUEST2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Level up your Bootstrap game by learning how to link files for your project.,,,,
BOOTQUEST2_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Let's keep the learning juices flowing and level-up your web development skills. In this activity, we will learn how to link files for Bootstrap to work.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_2,"We're going to pick up where we left off from the first Bootstrap quest so that we can focus on the most important parts. If you haven't gone through the first Bootstrap quest, we highly recommend that you work through that activity first.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_3,"Great! Let's get started. We've added the files you're going to use in the myproject folder. Let's take a look at the files. The lower-left corner of the screen with the icons is called the <b>taskbar</b>. Click the yellow folder to launch the file explorer. Click the Documents link on the left panel of the window and open the <b>myproject</b> folder. The folder should contain the index.html file and three folders: <b>css</b>, <b>images</b>, and <b>js</b>. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_4,"The images folder holds the images you will be using, the <b>CSS</b> folder holds all of the styling files, and the <b>JS</b> folder contains all of the Javascript files needed for your site. Let's take a look at the page we'll be using in this activity- <b>right-click</b> on the <b>index.html</b> file, and select <b>Open With Google Chrome</b>. If you are using a Hack computer, use two fingers and click on the mouse pad to <b>right-click</b>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_5,"Super! During load-time (when the page is loading), Chrome is using the internet to pull in (or <b>import</b>) the Bootstrap code from another location for your project. What happens to the webpage when there's no internet to get those files? Let's turn off your Wi-Fi and see what happens.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_6,"Turn off your Wi-Fi by clicking the battery icon located at the bottom right corner of the screen, click <b>Wi-Fi Settings</b>, and click <b>Turn Off</b>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_7,"Refresh the Chrome project browser by pressing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl + shift + r</span></tt> The browser tab that says *Hello, world!"" is your project browser. Oh no! Without the code in those Bootstrap files, Chrome wasn't able to build your page properly. Let's fix your website.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_8,"Open the <b>index.html</b> file in your project folder by clicking the yellow folder in the <b>taskbar</b> located at the bottom left corner of your screen, click the Documents link on the left panel, and open the <b>myproject</b> folder.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_9,"Using Sublime Text, we can open the index.html file and fix the code to return it to glory. Right-click on the index.html file and click <b>Open With Other Application</b>. If <b>Sublime Text</b> is already selected, click on it, and then the <b>Select</b> button at the top right corner of the window. Otherwise, click <b>View All Applications</b>, click <b>Sublime Text</b>, and click the <b>Select</b> button at the top right corner of the window. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_10,Great! Sublime Text should launch with the code for your website. Take a look at your code and try to guess why your website broke after we turned off the internet. The page doesn't load properly because we are using links that point to files on the internet. Let's find and fix those links.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_11,"On line 9, delete all the text after <b>href=</b> but keep the last <b>&gt;</b>. For example, Line 9 should look like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_12,"Awesome! We will add code to tell Chrome to look for the <b>Bootstrap CSS</b> files in the <b>CSS</b> folder on your computer. After <b>href=</b> on line 9, type in the following <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""css/bootstrap.min.css""</span></tt> So, line 9 should look like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/bootstrap.min.css""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_13,"Save your index.html file by hitting <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl + s</span></tt> You'll know the file saved when the (.) on the tab turns into an (x). Return to the Chrome browser by clicking the Chrome icon at the taskbar. Let's see what happens.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_14,"Refresh the Chrome project tab, and the stying for your page should return. We're not done just yet because the carousel at the top isn't moving. Let's keep working on the site.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_15,"Go back to Sublime Text by clicking the grey box with the <b>S</b> taskbar located at the bottom left corner of the screen. Similar to the first link you fixed earlier, lines 89 and 93 also points to an external website. Let's fix those too.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_16,"We're almost done. For lines 89 and 93, delete all of the text just after <b>src="" but keep *&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b>. For example, the likes should look like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;script src=&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_17,"Super! Let's tell Chrome where to find the <b>jQuery</b> file on your computer. Type in the following after <b>src=</b> <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js</span></tt> So, line 89 should look like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;script src=""js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,

BOOTQUEST2_20,Return to the Chrome browser by clicking the Chrome icon located at the bottom left corner of the screen and refresh the Chrome project tab. Let's see what happens.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_21,"You did it! By completing this activity, you learned how to create an <b>HTML</b> website using Bootstrap and link downloaded files from your computer to make it work. You've leveled up your skills as a Web Developer! Now, try using different Bootstrap components to add more content to your site and personalize it. Make it your own!",daemon,,,
