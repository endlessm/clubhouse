LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_QUESTION,Perhaps you're ready to code a whole new enemy on your own?,Saniel,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_LAUNCH,Start by launching LightSpeed.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_EXPLANATION,We'll add this enemy to level 6. Press the Flip button to go to the coding panel.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1,Here we are. Start by spawning 'squid' in the spawn_enemy() function. Then play the level to test it.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_PLAYTEST,Let's see if that worked...,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NOTMOVING,"Perfect. That's the new enemy type, although it's not doing anything interesting yet. Let's fix that.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NEWENEMY_HINT1,Go to the coding panel. Press flip to hack.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NOENEMY,Hmm... not quite. We don't have any of that enemy in the level. Go back and try to fix it.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2,"Now we want this enemy to move up and down smoothly, using the sine function.

sin() is a function that creates a smooth wave over time. So set y = sin(time); and try it.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_OFFSCREEN,The enemies are going offscreen. Go back and use the sin() function for their movement.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_SMALLMOVEMENT,"Hmm... that enemy isn't moving much, is it? That's because sin() returns a number between -1 and 1!

So right now it's just moving a pixel up and down. Go back to the code and let's change it.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE3,"How can we make it move more but still use the sin() function? Multiplying it of course!

Multiply sin(this.time) by some number to make it larger. Go ahead and try it.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE3_HINT1,Try something like 100.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE3_HINT2,enemy.position.y = enemy.initialY + 100*sin(time);,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_SUCCESS,"Much better! That number you chose is called the amplitude of the sine wave.

Something for you to think about. How could you make the enemy follow that pattern but more slowly?

Go back and try later if you want to. But for now this is enough. Great job coding your first enemy from scratch!",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_ABORT,Abort,,,
