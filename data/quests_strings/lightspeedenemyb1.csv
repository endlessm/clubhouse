LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_QUESTION,Perhaps you're ready to code a whole new enemy on your own?,Saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_QUEST_ACCEPT,That sounds intriguing!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_LAUNCH,Start by launching Lightspeed.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_EXPLANATION,We'll add a new enemy to Level 6: the *squid*. Press the Flip button to go to the coding panel.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_EXPLANATION_HINT1,Go to the coding panel. Press Flip.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1,Here we are. Start by spawning `squid` in the `spawnEnemy()` function. Then play the level to test it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1_HINT1,Go to the Spawn tab and look for the `spawnEnemy()` function.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1_HINT2,You need to have a `return squid;` there.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1_HINT3,And play the level to check when you're ready.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_ABOUTTOPLAY,"Now, go ahead and play the level. ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_PLAYTEST,Let's see if that worked.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NOTMOVING,"You got some *squids* all right, but they just go forward â€“ maybe we can give them some better *squid* moves.

Let's write some code and see if we can get them to move up and down.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NOTMOVING_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NOENEMY,Hmm That didn't quite work. We don't have any of that enemy in the level. Go back and try to fix it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2,"Click on the Squid tab and look for the `updateSquid()` function. We want them to move up and down randomly.

We can use the `random(a,b)` function that returns a number at random between a and b.

What could we do instead of always adding or subtracting a number to its `y` coordinate?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2_HINT1,Use the random function to give you a number between -20 and 20 for example.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2_HINT2,"That would be `random(-20,20)`.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2_HINT3,And add that to the current enemy `y` coordinate.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2_HINT4,"Like `enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + random(-20,20);`.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_OFFSCREEN,The enemies are going offscreen. Go back and use the sin() function for their movement.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_FINISHLEVEL,"Excellent! This is exactly what we were going for. So now, finish the level.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_SUCCESS,"Great! You can also choose different numbers in the `random()` function to get different results.

Go back and try later if you want to. But for now this is a great start. You just coded your first enemy from scratch!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_ABORT,"Okay, just check back later if you want to try some more coding. ",,,,
