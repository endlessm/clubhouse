MAZEPT1_QUESTION,"Whoa! The trap jumped to the desktop, as a new app called Sidetrack! Let's launch it!",Ada,,,quests/horse-tale
MAZEPT1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Ready!,,,,quests/horse-tale
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_ADA,Go ahead and Launch *Sidetrack*.,Ada,,,quests/horse-tale
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_ADA_HINT1,Click the *Sidetrack* icon on the desktop.,,,,quests/horse-tale
MAZEPT1_RILEYHELLO,"Oh, hheeeyyy, wassup? 
But, srsly, YOU GUYS!!! So glad to see you! That last part was pretty rough! 

Suddenly I'm just here in this maze 24/7. My life rn? Running. Looking for me? Catch me here, running! 

Forward, and up, Forward, and down. On the diagonal, I mean, actually it's not totally uncool. You'll see. ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_EXIT,"I'm learning tons in here, but I do hope to get back to my _actual_ classes one day. 

Hope all this counts for some extra credit in my ""Foundations of Machine Learning"" class, LOL.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_INTRO,"See that *Exit*? That's my dream, to get to that *Exit*. And you can help me get there!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1,"Use the FORWARD, UP, and DOWN *Instructions* to move me through these obstacles.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT1,"I always run one space to the right, but I can also move UP or DOWN at the same time.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT2,Watch out for those *Walls*!,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_DIED_RESTART,Ooopff. Let's try to avoid these *Walls*!,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL2,"Hey, that's not fair! Another level? I thought I just had to get the exit! But okay, let's do this. ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL3,This maze should have only ONE level!,Saniel,talk_anger,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4,"*Pits*? This is preposterous!  Riley will have to use her JUMP *Instruction* to cross the *Pits*!

There's a trick to the JUMP though! JUMP only works if the *Pit* is _directly_ in front of you. ",Saniel,talk_anger,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL5,"Well at least I like jumping! But I have to remember, you can only use a JUMP to go forward! ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTS1,"What are these? *Robot* insects? Insects, really? LOL. `Hi!` `My.` `Name.` `Is.` `Riley.` `What's.` `Your.` `Name.`",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTS2,"Okay, Riley, very funny. Be careful. Study how they move. Keep in mind that when you move, they're moving too. ",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTS3,Watch their movement carefully to plan your next move. Think about the space they open when they move.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTS3_HINT1,"These *Robots* only move DOWN, never left or right. Try to use their own rules to get past them. ",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTS3_HINT2,"And when they walk off the bottom, they reappear at the top! So keep your eye out for that!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_MOREROBOTS,"Another *Robot*! This type only moves UP, just like the first one only moves DOWN. They glow in the direction they move!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1,"*Robots!* & *Pits!* & *Walls,* oh my! Saniel, my friend, I've got this. I'll be bouncing this maze in no time ;)",Riley,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FELIX,mjau ^ = ^ mjav //\\ ngiyaw /\ ^  miav,FelixNet,,quests/glitch-meow,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FABER,Hold up. Listen. Was that more meowing? Did one of Saniel's cats follow Riley into the trap?,Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_ADA,Sounds like it! Riley? Your manual controls just totally disappeared. Something must be messing with them!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_RILEY,How am I ever going to get out of this maze if I can't move?,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_SANIEL_REACTION,This is most irregular! But look! I see that the maze has given you a set of *Instructions* already.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_SANIEL,See that PLAY button? Try pushing that.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_SANIEL_HINT1,Press the PLAY button to activate the *Instructions*.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2_INTRO,"You can still move, but now you have to plan all your moves in advance.

It's a new kind of challenge – you just have to give yourself time to think it through. ",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2,"After you have the *Instructions* lined up, you press PLAY and that moves you through the maze.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3,This set of *Instructions* won't cut it! Study the obstacles and put the *Instructions* in a new order.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT1,You’ll need to drag and drop those *Instructions* to put them in a new order.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT2,Press PLAY to execute the *Instructions* and get through the level.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT3,"And keep in mind, once you press PLAY you can no longer change the *Instructions!*",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_SUCCESS,Excellent! Riley sailed right through! Thanks to your strategic thinking! ,Saniel,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_FAILURE,Good try! Let's review the order of the *Instructions* and try again. Do you see a different order to try?,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY,I feel awful that Riley's stuck in there! I'm afraid it's all my own fault. I should know how to get her through this!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY2,"Saniel, we're all trying to figure this thing out. Don't be so hard on yourself.

How could you know this ancient thing would suddenly light up and swallow Riley? 

You didn't know there were levels and levels of mazes in there! It's not like you built it!",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY3,I’m afraid I did. ,Saniel,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY4,Wait. You did know about the mazes? Or do you mean you did BUILD IT?,Ada,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY5,"Hold on, Saniel, are you saying you built this trap? But then why–",Faber,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY6,"Yes. that’s exactly what I’m saying. This disaster is on me. I built this trap to confine and shut down rogue AIs!

It works by diverting and exhausting the AI, hence the name.",Saniel,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY7,"By _Sidetrack_ing them. Nice! I'm getting the picture. Saniel, when did you say you made this trap? ",Ada,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY8,"Ancient history, Ada. Right now, I'm just trying to get Riley out of there and back to her studies!

I'm reviewing the logs to see when this became active again. Something's in there wreaking havoc on the levels!",Saniel,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY9,"So many times I told Riley, _Don't go poking around in the Windows area_. Now we're really in a fix.

I won't let her down! I'm going to solve this the surest way I know: I'm going to go take _a catnap_.",Saniel,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY10,"I've seen that work before, Saniel!  I know you'll dream up a solution. Meanwhile, let's get back to *Sidetrack*!",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEJUMP_PRE,"Hey Riley, how's it going in there?	",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEJUMP,"Oh, hey Faber, you know, just chillin' in here! Any hope I might see the *Exit* soon?

At least this next level looks familiar. Should be a snap. ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEJUMP_ADA,But look closely. You only have one JUMP. Think strategically!,Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEJUMP_ADA_HINT1,"If you only have one JUMP, then you need to use it on the only pit you can't walk around.",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEFORWARD,"Ugh, here I am again! At least this time, I have two JUMP *Instructions.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEFORWARD_ADA,"Yes, but now you only have one FORWARD Instruction! Where should it go?",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEFORWARD_ADA_HINT1,"There's one place in this level that you _must_ move forward, not up or down. Use FORWARD there!",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_SLIDING,"Oh, truly awesome. So many DOWN *Instructions* and I need to move FORWARD! 

Hmmm, I wonder what happens when I use DOWN when I'm already at the bottom.

Hope I don't fall off. Maybe I'll sort of slide along the bottom edge? Only one way to find out!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_ADA1,"Hey Faber, wasn't that so intense when Saniel told us about making the trap! ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_FABER1,"Yeah, Saniel has always been a bit mysterious. Can't you totally picture him stopping rogue AIs in their tracks?",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_ADA2,Totally! But don't you think it's strange that he's just telling us this now? Riley's been in this trap for so long!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_FABER2,"Yeah, why couldn't he just, like, open it? That's totally not like Dr. Rowe. He always has a solution. ",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_ADA3,"Exactly. I have a hypothesis I've been investigating. The more I uncover, the more I think I'm onto something.  ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_RILEY,"Um, hello? Guys? Can you maybe discuss hypothetical matters later? I'm _actually_ in this maze right now. ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5,What’s _that_ *Instruction*? The one at position 3. Something's clearly _wrong_ with it!,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA,Try pressing PLAY just to see if you can get through anyway.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA_HINT1,Let's just give it a try so we can see what it does. Press PLAY.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA,"Okay, I'm always up for trying things, but that def didn't work. ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA2,"Right. There must be an error in the code.  To be sure we’ll need to get in there to see the code.

For that, we’ll need the *Instructions* panel key. Oh boy, here we go. Saniel probably has it. ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_SUCCESS,"I just checked in with Saniel. He was indeed half asleep. But he says we can find that key inside *Lightspeed*. 

He stashed it there long ago ""to keep it safe,"" LOL. Saniel never forgets anything! 

Meet me at the clubhouse, and we’ll go find it together.",Faber,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_ABORT,Come find me later and we can keep working on this! ,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_WASTEJUMPS,"Think about it, you don't have to have a *Pit* in front of you to use a JUMP. 

Maybe you could use a JUMP to go forward? You never know when that will come in handy!",Ada,,,
