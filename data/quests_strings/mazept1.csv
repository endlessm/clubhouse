MAZEPT1_QUESTION_ACCEPT,CONFIRMED!,,,,
MAZEPT1_TRANSFER,TRANSFER TO DESKTOP: 100% SUCCESSFUL,,,,
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_ADA,Did you see that!? Riley's box is an app now! We should launch it!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1,"YOU GUYS!  Serrriousssly glad to see you! Kind of rad in here, but hoping to get out ASAP! 

Suddenly I'm in this maze. My life rn? Running 24/7. Looking for me? Catch me here, running forward. 

Running forward, and up. Running forward, and down. Even running on a diagonal! 

See that Exit? That's my dream, to get to the exit. Until then, it's constant motion for me!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT1,"Use the FORWARD, UP, and DOWN Instructions to move me through the maze.",,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT2,"I always run one space to the right, but I can also move UP or DOWN at the same time.",,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT3,Watch out for those walls!,,,,
MAZEPT1_DIED_RESTART,"Ouch! I might look virtual here in this app, but it still smarts when I bump into walls!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL2,Oh no! Are you kidding me? Another level! How many can there be?,,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL3,"This is preposterous! This maze should have only one level!

Something has been in there wreaking havoc with it!",Saniel,talk_anger,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4,"Is that a pit I see in the ground!  Impossible! How does a pit just suddenly open in the ground?

When I….ahhh…. previously, in my experience with mazes of this type, you'd only have walls. ",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4_HINT1,Riley will have to use her JUMP Instruction to cross the pits!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1,"Really? You call yourself a maze, Maze?  If that's all you've got, I'll be out of here in no time.",Riley,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FELIX,mjau ^ = ^ mjav //\\ ngiyaw /\ ^  miav,Felix,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FABER,Did you hear that? Did I just hear more meowing coming from in there? What is up with that? ,Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_ADA,"Wait, Rile, I'm not seeing your manual controls. They're gone. What is happening?",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_RILEY,How am I going to get out of this maze if I can't move!?,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_SANIEL,This is most irregular! I'm seeing that it has given you a set of Instructions already.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_HINT1,See that PLAY button? Try pushing that.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2,"It looks like you can still move, but you have to decide in advance which Instructions to execute.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2_HINT1,Press PLAY again to get through this new level.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3,"To solve this level, you'll need to decide on a strategy and reorder the Instructions accordingly.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT1,You’ll need to drag and drop those Instructions to put them in a new order.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT2,Press PLAY when you’re ready.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_SUCCESS,Well played! You ordered the Instructions so that Riley sailed right out of this level! Excellent thinking!,Saniel,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_FAILURE,"Shoot! Make sure you put the Instructions in an order that gets Riley safely to the exit.

Once you press PLAY you can no longer change the Instructions!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY,"I need to tell this to someone. Long ago I created this maze! This thing was state-of-the-art, in its time! 

Its whole purpose was to divert and exhaust rogue AIs who infiltrate the System, and it did that beautifully. 

But it's gone terribly wrong now and swallowed up our Riley! This is tearing me up! I just didn't see that coming.

I'm so careful, and it's been defunct for ages. I've been reviewing the commit logs and something's awry. ",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY2,"It appears that someone – or some*thing* – has been in here running fast and loose with levels.

From the looks of it, it's been in here for quite some time, propagating levels and making them harder! 

I told Riley time and time again not to be poking around in the Windows area, now we're really in a fix.

I will not let her down. I'm going to go solve this the fastest, surest way I know: I'm going to go take a catnap.",,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5,"Um, hello? What’s THAT instruction!? The one at position 6. Something's all WRONG with it!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA,Try pressing PLAY just to see if you can get through anyway.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA_HINT1,There's no way forward unless we at least try!,,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA,"That Instruction does some biZarre things to me! Not digging it at all. 

And I for sure can’t get through this level with that Instruction in the mix.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA2,"You’re right. I think there must be a syntax error, but to be sure we’ll need to see the code.

And to see the code, we’ll need the Instructions panel key. Oh boy, here we go. Saniel probably has it. ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_SUCCESS,"Hey guys! I just checked in with Saniel. He was half-asleep, but he says he knows where we can find that key.

He stashed it inside Lightspeed long ago, ""to keep it safe,"" LOL. Saniel never forgets anything!

Meet me at the clubhouse, and we’ll go find it together.",Faber,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_ABORT,Come find me later and we can keep working on this! ,Ada,,,
