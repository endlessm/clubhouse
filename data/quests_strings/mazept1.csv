MAZEPT1_QUESTION_ACCEPT,CONFIRMED!,,,,
MAZEPT1_TRANSFER,TRANSFER TO DESKTOP: 100% SUCCESSFUL,,,,
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_ADA,Did you see that!? Riley's box is an app now! We should launch it!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1,"YOU GUYS!  Serrriousssly glad to see you! Kind of rad in here, but hoping to get out ASAP! 

The maze propels me forward. This is my life rn: Running forward 24/7. 

Looking for me? Catch me here, running forward. Forward, and up. Forward, and down. Even Diagonal! 

See that Exit? That's my dream, to get to the exit. Until then, it's constant motion for me!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT1,"Use the FORWARD, UP, and DOWN Instructions to move me through the maze.",,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT2,"I always run one space to the right, but I can also move UP or DOWN at the same time.",,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT3,Watch out for those walls!,,,,
MAZEPT1_DIED_RESTART,"Ouch! I might look virtual here in this app, but it still smarts when I bump into walls!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL2,Oh no! Are you kidding me? Another level! How many can there be?,,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL3,"This is preposterous! This maze should have only one level!

Something has been in there wreaking havoc with it!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4,"Is that a pit I see in the ground!  Impossible!  How did pits suddenly appear!??

There were only walls inside this maze when I …. ahhh…. previously!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4_HINT1,Riley will have to use her JUMP Instruction to cross the pits!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1,Is that all this maze can throw at us? We’ll get out of here in no time.,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FELIX,mjau ^ = ^ mjav //\\ ngiyaw /\ ^  miav,Felix,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FABER,What was that!?,Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_ADA,Where did your controls go!?,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_RILEY,How am I going to get out of this maze if I can't move!?,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_SANIEL,Very alarming! It has given you a set of Instructions already.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_HINT1,See that PLAY button? Try pushing that.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2,It looks like you can still move as long as you decide in advance which Instructions to execute.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2_HINT1,Press PLAY again to get through this new level.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3,"Hmmm. To solve this level, you'll need to reorder the Instructions.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT1,You’ll need to drag and drop those Instructions to put them in a new order.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT2,Press PLAY when you’re ready.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_SUCCESS,That’s it! You put the Instructions in an order that got Riley out of this level! Excellent thinking!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_FAILURE,"Shoot! Make sure you put the Instructions in an order that gets Riley safely to the exit.

Once you press PLAY you can no longer change the Instructions!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4,"I have a horrible confession. It was me who created this maze!

It was supposed to be a trap in case any rogue AIs were sneaking around the System.

I never intended for a student to fall into it, even one as mischievous as Riley!  I feel such guilt!

That said, someone or something has been modifying this trap. I'm looking at the commit logs.

Seems it’s been in here for many years, growing the trap and making it harder and harder! 

This is all my fault! I better go figure out what to do about this.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5,Uh… what’s THAT instruction!? The one at position 6. Something looks WRONG with it!,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA,Try pressing PLAY to see if you can get through anyway.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA_HINT1,There's no way forward unless we at least try!,,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE,"That Instruction does some crazy things to me! I don’t like it!

And I for sure can’t get through this level with it in here.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA,"You’re right. I think there must be a syntax error, but to be sure we’ll need to see the code.

And for that we’ll need the Instructions panel key.",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_SUCCESS,"Hey guys! I just checked in with Saniel. He’s still moping, but he says he remembers the key.

He left it inside Lightspeed, long ago. Meet me at the clubhouse, and we’ll go get it together.",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ABORT,PLEASE COME BACK LATER,,,,
