MAZEPT1_QUESTION,TRANSCODING COMPLETE. READY FOR NEXT STEP?,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_QUESTION_ACCEPT,CONFIRM,,,,
MAZEPT1_TRANSFER,TRANSFER TO DESKTOP SUCCESSFUL,,,,
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_ADA,Did you see that!? Riley's box is an app now! We should launch it!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_SANIEL,Great! Now you can enter the box and help Riley escape. It should be easy from here!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_FABER,"The box just turned into an app! Well, don’t waste any time, get in there!",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1,"Finally! I’ve been exploring around as I waited for you. But I have to get OUT of here!

I don’t know what’s going on, but this maze makes me run forward.  I’m in constant motion!  

I HAVE to go forward every moment! I can also run up and down at the same time, on a diagonal. 

Help me get to the exit!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT1,"Use the FORWARD, UP, and DOWN Instructions to move me through the maze.",,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT2,"I always run one space to the right, but I can also move UP or DOWN at the same time.",,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT3,Don't bump into any walls!,,,,
MAZEPT1_DIED_RESTART,"Ouch! I'm only virtual inside this app, but it still smarts when I screw up like that!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL2,Oh no! Another level! I wonder how many there are?,,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL3,"This is preposterous! There should only be one level in this maze!

Someone has been tampering with it!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4,"Is that a pit I see in the ground!  Impossible!  How did pits suddenly appear!??

There were only walls inside this maze when I …. ahhh…. previously!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4_HINT1,Riley will have to use her JUMP Instruction to cross the pits!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1,Is that all this maze can throw at us? We’ll get out of here in no time.,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FELIX,Bzrt bzrt meow,Felix,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FABER,What was that!?,Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_ADA,Where did your controls go!?,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_RILEY,How am I going to get out of this maze if I can't move!?,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_SANIEL,Very alarming! It has given you a set of Instructions already.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_HINT1,See that PLAY button? Try pushing that.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2,It looks like you can still move as long as you decide in advance which Instructions to execute.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2_HINT1,Press PLAY again to get through this new level.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3,"Hmmm. To solve this level, you'll need to reorder the Instructions.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT1,You’ll need to drag and drop those Instructions to put them in a new order.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT2,Press PLAY when you’re ready.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_SUCCESS,That’s it! You put the Instructions in an order that got Riley out of this level! Excellent thinking!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_FAILURE,"Shoot! Make sure you put the Instructions in an order that gets Riley safely to the exit.

Once you press PLAY you can no longer change the Instructions!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4,"I have a horrible confession. It was me who created this maze!

It was supposed to be a trap in case any rogue AIs were sneaking around the System.

I never intended for a student to fall into it, even one as mischievous as Riley!  I feel such guilt!

That said, someone or something has been modifying this trap. I'm looking at the commit logs.

Seems it’s been in here for many years, growing the trap and making it harder and harder! 

This is all my fault! I better go figure out what to do about this.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5,Uh… what’s THAT instruction!? The one at position 6. Something looks WRONG with it!,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA,Try pressing PLAY to see if you can get through anyway.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA_HINT1,There's no way forward unless we at least try!,,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE,"That Instruction does some crazy things to me! I don’t like it!

And I for sure can’t get through this level with it in here.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA,"You’re right. I think there must be a syntax error, but to be sure we’ll need to see the code.

And for that we’ll need the Instructions panel key.",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_SUCCESS,"Hey guys! I just checked in with Saniel. He’s still moping, but he says he remembers the key.

He left it inside Lightspeed, long ago. Meet me at the clubhouse, and we’ll go get it together.",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ABORT,PLEASE COME BACK LATER,,,,
