LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_QUESTION,Should we make that new Lightspeed enemy a bit easier?,Riley,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_LAUNCH,"OK, guess which app to launch.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_LAUNCH_HINT1,Lightspeed! ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_EXPLAIN,"All right. So right now the *beam* moves towards the player relentlessly. It's impossible to beat.

Let's see if you can fix it so you can beat this level. Go to the coding panel.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ADD_ENEMY_CODE,Select the Spawn tab and make sure the `spawnEnemy` function creates a *Beam* enemy!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ADD_ENEMY_CODE_HINT1,Make sure to return a `beam` enemy in the `spawnEnemy` function!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ADD_ENEMY_CODE_HINT2,Change the `spawnEnemy` function so it produces *Beam* enemies: `return beam;`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE,"Go to the Beam tab. Look at the `updateBeam()` function. This is different from the other enemies we've seen.

See those `if` statements? It's checking if `playerShip.position.y` is higher and moving up, or lower and moving down.

So it's tracking the player! Change the code so the enemy still moves some but it's easier to beat the level.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT1,What if we reverse the effect?,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT2,"So when the player is higher than the enemy, the enemy moves down and the other way around.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT3,"So instead of subtracting 5, add 5. Also flip the other statement.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT4,So `if (playerShip.position.y < enemy.position.y) enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 5;`,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Let's play now.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_PLAYTEST,Let's see if the enemies are moving correctly...,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_NOENEMIES,Weird. I don't see any enemies anymore. Did you change something? Let's fix it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_NOTMOVING,They're not moving at all. Something must be wrong. Let's check.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_MOVING,Cool. We got the enemies moving. Now try to beat the level. Let's see if you made it easy enough...,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_FAILED,"If that's too difficult, go back to the code and fix the enemy to make it move away from you.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_SUCCESS,That's what I'm talking about! Great job!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ABORT,Check ya later!,,,,
