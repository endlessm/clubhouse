P5JSSOUND3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In the last part of this set of quests, you'll put together all the elements you've used so far to get things crazy!",,,,
P5JSSOUND3_1,"Welcome back, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Are you ready to put on a real light show? I know I am!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_2,"First things first - let's get back to the p5.js code editor. You can load your previous sketch (if you saved it at <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4""><a href=""http://editor.p5js.org"">http://editor.p5js.org</a></span></u> ), or get back to where we left off with this one: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4""><a href=""https://editor.p5js.org/madetohack/sketches/HNfYgEbV"">https://editor.p5js.org/madetohack/sketches/HNfYgEbV</a></span></u>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_3,"Last time, we created something pretty cool, but it had 2 problems. First, it only used circles. Second, the circles got ‘stuck’ on a color sometimes. Let’s fix both of those problems and make a more impressive sound painter!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_4,"First, let’s fix the problem of the color “sticking”. In your first <b>if statement</b>, the one dealing with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">volume &gt; 0.1</span></tt>, let’s add a new line just above the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">circle(...</span></tt> line: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill(255, 255, 255)</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_5,"That line will 'reset' the color when the volume is <b>greater than 0.1</b> but <b>less than 0.2</b>. Next, let’s change what happens when the volume is <b>greater than 0.2</b>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_6,"In the <b>if statement</b> that handles when <b>volume is above 0.2</b>, delete the line that says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">circle(...</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_7,"Let’s replace that with: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">line(random(width), random(height), random(width), random(height));</span></tt> We need to have 2 groups of <b>random</b>s because a line gets drawn from one point to a second point – and we need to create both points, instead of just one for the circle.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_8,"If you run the code now, you should get some lines… but they won’t be very colorful. That’s because lines don’t care about <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill()</span></tt>, they need a different <b>function</b> to color them.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_9,"Fortunately, it’s easy to fix that – on the line above <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">line(...</span></tt>, change <b>fill</b> to <b>stroke</b>. If you run the code again, you’ll see the lines are now a different color!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_10,"If you’d like the lines to be thicker, you can make a new line above the one with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke(...</span></tt> on it, and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">strokeWeight(7)</span></tt> on it.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_11,"Awesome! Run your code and watch it go! Tweak the values in your code if you want to change things up – Maybe you want the <b>if statements</b> to cover different volume ranges, or the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">strokeWeight()</span></tt> to be higher or lower… or maybe you want every circle to be a different color!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_12,"Whatever you choose, you’re going to have something pretty cool to show your friends. Happy Hacking!",daemon,,,
