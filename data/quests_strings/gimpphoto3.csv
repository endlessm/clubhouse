GIMPPHOTO3_QUEST_NAME,Edit a Photo - Adding something new!,,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In this activity, you'll learn to use the Smart Scissors Tool to ""cut"" an object from one picture and ""paste"" it into another!",,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_1,"Hey there! Good to see you again, let's get started. Let me fire up GIMP, and I can show you how to copy an object from one image to another. Today, we'll copy a star. In the future, it can be anything you want!",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_2,"Now that you're in GIMP, go to <b>File &gt; Open</b>... and use the file browser that appears to select your <b>home</b> directory (the one with your username, on the left side of the file browser). Once you're there, navigate into your <b>Pictures</b> folder, then into <b>PhotoSources</b>. You'll find a file I've left for you, <b>star.png</b>. Click Open!",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_3,"Next choose a picture of your own that looks like it might need a star. You can always download from Wikipedia or Google if you don't have one. Just save it to your <b>home</b> folder, then in the <b>Downloads</b> folder.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_4,Have you ever taken a picture and wished it looked a little better? It's time to learn how computers can improve your photos! We're going to use a program called GIMP. I'll open it for you.,daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_5,"You should now have two images in the top left part of GIMP. These are <b>thumbnails</b>, or tiny versions of the pictures. Each <b>thumbnail</b> is a tab. Try clicking on them to switch back and forth, but don't click the X by each one. That will close the tab! If it happens, just go to <b>File &gt; Open</b> again.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_6,"Now select the tab with the picture you chose. We're getting ready for our star, so first we'll need to create a shiny new Layer. Look for the Layer list, probably on the right side. You should see an eyeball next to a list of the Layers you have here. Now what's a Layer?",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_7,"Each Layer is like a sheet of thin, transparent plastic. If you draw or put an image on a Layer, then it works like a clear sheet with a picture on it. If you stack the Layers, you'll see all the images on top of each other.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_8,"See that little sheet icon with a plus symbol? It's underneath the Layer list, on the left. Click on it to create a new Layer, and then double-click on the name of that Layer. You can rename it to <b>star</b> or something similar.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_9,"Now click on the <b>thumbnail</b> of the star near the top of the window. This will switch to that picture. We've got a nice fresh layer just waiting for it on the other photo, but we need to make sure we only copy the star and not that white background.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_10,"We'll need the Scissors Select Tool, which looks like...well, scissors. It's next to an icon that looks like a little person. With the Scissors Select Tool, you can click and drag to create a line. Do this along part of the outline of the star. If the line ends up bent, you can click-and-drag on the bent part.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_11,"Try clicking on each new point of the outline and let the computer fill in the line. If you put a line in the wrong place, Undo will get rid of it. If the computer makes a line all zigzag for no reason, click-and-drag it into shape. If that makes a smaller zigzag, just do the same thing again.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_12,"Keep going till you make it all the way around the star. The smoother your lines are, the nicer the finished project will look. You want these lines to trace the outside of your object (in this case, a star) as closely as possible. You'll see why soon.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_13,"Once your outline is complete, you can click inside it or press enter. This turns the area into a <b>selection</b>. Once that area is <b>selected</b> you are ready to Cut or Copy your star.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_14,"Cut and Copy will both take a copy of your star that you can add to the other picture, but Cut will also remove it from this picture. I like to use Cut so I can see if it worked. If I mess up, I just use Undo! Cut is <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl+x</span></tt>, and Copy is <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl+c</span></tt>.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_15,"Awesome! Now go back to the tab with the picture you chose. (Click the thumbnail of your picture at the top left.) Make sure the empty <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Star</span></tt> Layer is selected (or whatever you named it). Next use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl+v</span></tt> to Paste the star into this image. Don't click on anything else yet.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_16,"Use the Move Tool (two crossed arrows in a T shape) to drag your star into the position you want. Remember that you can see the names of Tools by hovering over them. Now, let me explain exactly where your star is. You can see it just fine, but do you know which Layer it's on?",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_17,"Right now it's not on a Layer at all! It's just floating in space. You may have noticed a new Layer in your layer list, called ""Floating Selection (Pasted Layer)."" When you have it in the right place, move the cursor off your star. When you see a little anchor appear by your cursor, click.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_18,"Did the Floating Selection layer disappear? That's because the <b>selection</b> that was floating in midair (the star) is now <b>anchored</b> to the Layer called ""Star."" Basically, you told GIMP where that floating thing should land and now it's stuck on that Layer.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_19,"You can still use the Move Tool to move the star around, but now you're moving the whole Layer as well. Wanna see a cool trick?",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_20,"You can turn your star transparent with the Opacity slider, just on top of the Layer list. If your mouse is in the top half of that bar, you can click to drag it. If your mouse is in the bottom half of the Opacity bar, you can click to enter a number value (out of 100). Try it!",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_21,"When your star is in a good place and you like the Opacity, you're ready to go to <b>File &gt; Save As</b>. Remember, if you use <b>Save</b> instead of <b>Save As</b>, it will save over the original photo! Save As will make a copy with your changes.",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_22,"For your next projects, you can also change the size of what you Copy and Paste. Just right-click on the Layer and select ""Scale Layer,"" then enter the dimensions you'd like it to be!",daemon2,,,
GIMPPHOTO3_23,"Do you know what your next work of art will be? Whatever you decide, be sure to have fun!",daemon2,,,
