POWERUPA2_QUESTION,"Okay, so let's keep working on some more powerups. Are you with me?",Saniel,,,
POWERUPA2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Totally!,,,,
POWERUPA2_LAUNCH,Let's go to Lightspeed again.,,,,
POWERUPA2_LAUNCH_HINT1,You know the drill: Desktop. Lightspeed icon. Click.,,,,
POWERUPA2_EXPLAIN,"Now that we've spawned a powerup, let's see what special powers they can give us!

For the first powerup, let's imagine what we could do if nothing could harm the ship. Let's try it!

We'll make the ship invulnerable for five seconds. Flip to the code panel.",,,,
POWERUPA2_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPA2_CODE,"Click on the Powerups tab. See that `activatePowerup()` function? That will get executed when we pick up the powerup.

Right now it's empty, so it does nothing. Let's make the ship invulnerable there.

There's a variable in the ship called `invulnerableTimer`. Set it to 5 seconds.",,,,
POWERUPA2_CODE_HINT1,`ship.invulnerableTimer = 5;`,,,,
POWERUPA2_CODE_HINT2,Now run the level as usual.,,,,
POWERUPA2_PLAYTEST,Let's see if that worked. Try picking up a powerup when you see it.,,,,
POWERUPA2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and play the level now.,,,,
POWERUPA2_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPA2_PLAY_AGAIN,Oh! The ship crashed while I was waiting for a powerup to be spawned!,,,,
POWERUPA2_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Let's try again.,,,,
POWERUPA2_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT2,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPA2_PICKEDUP,"That's it. You're invulnerable now! That means if your ship crashes into something, it will survive!",,hurray,,
POWERUPA2_NOT_ACTIVATED,Hmm you picked the powerup but didn't get any special powers. Go back to check.,,,,
POWERUPA2_NOT_PICKED,Nothing picked. Are the powerups actually being spawned? Go back to check.,,,,
POWERUPA2_OTHER_PICKED,Hmm you picked a different kind. Spawn the `'invulnerable'`powerup.,,,,
POWERUPA2_FINISHLEVEL,"Okay, so go ahead and finish the level now.",,,,
POWERUPA2_SUCCESS,Excellent! Those powerups definitely gave us an advantage. ,,,,
POWERUPA2_ABORT,No prob. Hope you'll check back later. ,,,,
