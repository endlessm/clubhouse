POWERUPA2_QUESTION,"Okay, so let's keep working on some more Power-ups. Are you with me?",Saniel,,,
POWERUPA2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Totally!,,,,
POWERUPA2_LAUNCH,Let's go to Lightspeed again.,,,,
POWERUPA2_LAUNCH_HINT1,You know the drill: Desktop. Lightspeed icon. Click.,,,,
POWERUPA2_EXPLAIN,"Now that we've spawned a Power-up, let's see what special powers they can give us!

For the first Power-up, let's imagine what we could do if nothing could harm the ship. Let's try it!

We'll make the ship invulnerable for five seconds. Flip to the code panel.",,,,
POWERUPA2_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPA2_CODE,"Click on the Power-Up tab, at the bottom. See that `activatePowerup()` function? 

Right now it's empty, so it does nothing. Let's make the ship invulnerable there.

There's a variable called `ship.invulnerableTimer`. Set it to 5 seconds. This is a bit tricky. 

It's totally okay to ask for a hint if you're not sure how to do this! ",,,,
POWERUPA2_CODE_HINT1,"Beneath `if (powerUpType === invulnerable) {`, type in `ship.invulnerableTimer = 5;`",,,,
POWERUPA2_CODE_HINT2,Now start the level as usual.,,,,
POWERUPA2_PLAYTEST,Let's see if that worked. Try picking up a Power-up when you see it.,,,,
POWERUPA2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and play the level now.,,,,
POWERUPA2_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPA2_PLAY_AGAIN,Uh oh. The ship crashed while we were waiting for a Power-up to be spawned!,,,,
POWERUPA2_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Let's give it another try. Coding is all about trying something and seeing how it plays out! ,,,,
POWERUPA2_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT2,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPA2_PICKEDUP,"That's it. You're invulnerable now! That means if your ship crashes into something, it will survive!",,hurray,,
POWERUPA2_NOT_ACTIVATED,Hmm. Odd. You picked up the Power-up but didn't get any special powers. Go back to check.,,,,
POWERUPA2_NOT_PICKED,Nothing picked. Are the Power-ups actually being spawned? Go back to check.,,,,
POWERUPA2_OTHER_PICKED,"I see. You spawned a Power-up, but not the kind you wanted. Spawn the `'invulnerable'` Power-up.",,,,
POWERUPA2_FINISHLEVEL,"Okay, so go ahead and finish the level now.",,,,
POWERUPA2_SUCCESS,Excellent! Those Power-ups definitely open up new possibilities! ,,,,
POWERUPA2_ABORT,No prob. Hope you'll check back later. ,,,,
