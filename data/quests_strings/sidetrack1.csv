SIDETRACK1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Explore a new game with Riley, full of robots and pits!",,,,
SIDETRACK1_LAUNCH_ADA,"Hi, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! I've got a new game for you to try out. It's called <b>Sidetrack</b>, and it should be sitting on your desktop. Let's check it out!",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_LAUNCH_ADA_HINT1,Click the <b>Sidetrack</b> icon on the desktop.,,,,quests/horse-tale
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_ADA,"Last summer, we decided to try something new - Instead of a book report, or an essay, all the students here at The Academy had to build a game.

The game had to focus on a maze of some kind, and require hacking in order to beat it. Each student needed to own the project and manage it themselves, but they could ask anyone around The Academy for help and guidance.

You've probably guessed whose project this is already - our star student, Riley!",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_RILEY,"Oh, jeez... Um, yeah. I didn't do everything, I mean, Ada helped a ton with design, and Saniel helped me with the code, and Felix-- ",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_FABER,"Don't sell yourself short, Riley! It takes a lot of skill and talent to put something like this together, and no big project is ever a one-person job. How do you think I weld big pieces together? ",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_STUDENT,"... I guess you need someone to hold them in place. Well, yeah. So, <b>{{user_name}}</b>, you ready to try out <b>Sidetrack</b>?",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_ESTELLE,"Oh, hello! Seems I just made it before everything started. I'm very interested to see what you've come up with, Riley.",estelle,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_SANIEL,"Indeed, as are we all. Let's dim the lights, shall we? Riley, the room is yours.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL1_INTRO,Woohoo! Here we are! See that <b>Exit</b> on the far side of the screen? That's our goal! Let's get there!,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL1,"Use the FORWARD, UP, and DOWN <b>Instructions</b> to move through these obstacles.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL1_HINT1,"I always run one space to the right, but I can also move UP or DOWN at the same time.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL1_HINT2,Watch out for those <b>Walls</b>!,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_DIED_RESTART,"Ow. This might be virtual, but that's still uncomfortable. Let's try to avoid the <b>Walls</b>, OK?",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL2,"Haha, another level! What, you thought I'd just let you go after the exit? Nope, this is only the beginning!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL3,"Nice job on the music, Riley. Looks like all our jam sessions paid off!",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL4,"Oh ho! <b>Pits</b>, eh? I wonder how you'll cross those...",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL5,"You need to use the <b>Jump</b> instruction to cross <b>Pits</b>! There's a trick to it, though. <b>Jump</b> can only cross a <b>pit</b> if it's <b>directly</b> in front of you.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL6,"BTW, those pits weren't easy to draw... it's tough trying to get that feeling of a deep, black hole, but only using colors.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL7,"Riley, you did extremely well. I wish every student had your drive!",estelle,,,
SIDETRACK1_ROBOTS1,"Hey Riley, I think your game has some <b>bugs</b>, LOL! What a cool bunch of robots. <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Beep. Boop. Hello. Faber. I. Am. A. Bugbot.</span></tt>",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_ROBOTS2,"I knew you'd like that one, Faber :D

Stay alert, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! The bugbots move when you do, so you'll have to plan out your moves carefully.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ROBOTS3,"Watch how the bugbots move and where they go, and think about the spaces they open up when they move.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ROBOTS3_HINT1,"These bugbots <b>only move down</b>, never left or right, so that might let you find a... bug... in their behavior.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ROBOTS3_HINT2,"Oh, and when they walk off the bottom, they reappear at the top! So keep your eye out for that!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MOREROBOTS,"Time for new bugbots! This new type <b>only moves up</b>, just like the first <b>only moves down</b>. Be sure to note which way they're facing...",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1,"Bugbots, pits... Riley, you've done a great job here.",ada,hurray,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_FELIX,"<i>mjau ^ = ^ mjav //\\ ngiyaw /\ ^  miav, meow!</i>",felixnet,,quests/glitch-meow,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_FABER,What was <b>that</b>? Riley?,faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_ADA,"I think we have a problem! Riley, it looks like the manual controls for your maze just disappeared. Any ideas?",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_PLOT,"I was wondering when Felix would show up. For once, he's on time and doing exactly what I asked him to. <b>Now</b> things are going to get interesting!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_ESTELLE_REACTION,"Look, <b>{{user_name}}</b> - there's a pre-made set of instructions already here.",estelle,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_RILEY,"And now, we enter hard-mode! See that <b>Play</b> button? Try pushing it.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_RILEY_HINT1,"If you press the <b>Play</b> button, it'll activate the <b>Instructions</b>.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO2_INTRO,"In this mode, we can still move around the level, but you'll have to plan all your moves in advance. Just think it through, and you'll pass these levels in no time.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO2,"Once your instructions are laid out in the order you want them, press <b>play</b> to start our journey through the maze.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3,"Hmm, there's just no way this set of instructions could finish this level. You'll have to re-order them.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3_HINT1,Drag and drop the instructions to re-order them.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3_HINT2,"Press <b>Play</b> to execute the <b>Instructions</b>  - and hopefully, get through the level.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3_HINT3,"Oh yeah, and once your press play? That's it for that run, no changing instructions around until you succeed... or fail!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3_SUCCESS,"Fantastic work, you practically sailed through that level, <b>{{user_name}}</b>. Excellent planning!",saniel,hurray,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3_FAILURE,"Not quite, but you're getting there. Review the order of the <b>Instructions</b> and try again. It might help to try and work backward from the ending.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO4_SANIEL,"Riley - I can see the progression from puzzle-solving to strategic planning in this game, and I'm impressed.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO4_RILEY,"Woah. T-thanks, Saniel! That really means a lot to me.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEJUMP_PRE,"Hey Riley, how's your maze going?",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEJUMP,"It's pretty... a-maze-ing! :D Seriously, <b>{{user_name}}</b> I hope you're having as much fun as we are. It's so cool to see someone play something I helped build!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEJUMP_ADA,"Ah hah, look at your instructions carefully. You've only got one jump, so use it well.",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEJUMP_ADA_HINT1,"If there's only one jump to use, you'll have to use other ways of getting around all the other pits.",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEFORWARD,Let's turn the heat up - now you've got 2 Jumps.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEFORWARD_ADA,"It might look easier, but now you only have a single forward instruction. Think carefully about where you might need it.",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEFORWARD_ADA_HINT1,"I'm pretty sure there's only one spot in this level that you absolutely <b>must</b> move forward, and not down or up. Can you find it?",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_SLIDING,"I'd say something about this level bringing me <b>down</b>, but this game is too cool for that. How are you supposed to move forward when all you can do is go down, though? Might as well give it a shot!",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_WASTEJUMPS,"You know, you don't have to have a pit in front of you to use a jump instruction. Maybe you could use jump to go forward? You never know when that will come in handy!",,,,
SIDETRACK1_DRAMA_ADA,This looks... familliar.,ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_DRAMA_FABER,"With a twist, though. Let's get to it!",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5,What’s up with the instruction at <b>position 3</b>? There's something very wrong with it!,estelle,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5_ADA,"Interesting, I wonder what happens if we just press Play and try to forge ahead?",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5_ADA_HINT1,There's no way forward unless we at least try! Press Play.,ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5_FAILURE_SANIEL,"Well, at least we've proved that there's a problem.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5_FAILURE_SANIEL2,"There's clearly an error, but we’ll need to see the code to debug it.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA,"Yes, I see where this is going - I think we've reached a good point to take a break, I'm sure we could all use it.",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_SUCCESS,"Congrats, Riley - This is an awesome project you've pulled together. We'll meet back up here later to keep going, and debug that broken instruction. See you in the next activity!",faber,hurray,,
SIDETRACK1_ABORT,"Come find me later, and we'll get back into it!",riley,,,
