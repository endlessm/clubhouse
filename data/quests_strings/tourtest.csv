TOURTEST_ABORT,"OK, we can stop - but if you ever need to come back, you can &lt;HOW TO INVOKE HELP ON DEMAND&gt;",dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_INTRO,"Hey there, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Welcome to Endless OS! Whenever you see a box like this, you can click the <b>❯</b> button to move to the next message.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_FIRSTCOMP,"Is this your first computer? If it is, I can go over some of the basics, like how to use the mouse and keyboard... and you might learn a few tricks, too!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_NOTFIRST,"Great, you know your way around already.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_ISFIRST,Congratulations! Let's get into the basics.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_OS,"OK. If you've used another computer before, what kind was it?
If you're not sure, select ""Windows"".",dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_OS_MAC,Mac (Apple),dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_OS_WIN,Windows (Microsoft),dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_END,"Great - I'll try and explain Endless OS in a way that matches your current computer, as well as ones you've used in the past.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_GREET,"OK, let's start! Endless OS is a little different from other computers you might have used before, but you can still do everything you need to.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_COMEBACK,"Once we're done, you can come back to this guide by &lt;HOW TO INVOKE HELP ON DEMAND&gt;.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_KBM1,"Now that we know what kind of computer you have, let's start learning about it.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE1,"I know you've already figured out the basics of your mouse, since you're clicking on things on the screen! There are some other things that are important, though.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE2,"The little arrow on the screen is called the <b>cursor</b> - so if I talk about moving the cursor somewhere, that means move your mouse so that the arrow on the screen does what it needs to.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_DESK1,"Your mouse usually has two buttons, <b>left</b> and <b>right</b>, and might also have a <b>scroll wheel</b> in the center.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_DESK2,"When something tells you to <b>click</b> or <b>left-click</b>, press the left mouse button down once, until you feel and hear the ""click."" Be gentle!
When something tells you to <b>right-click</b>, press the right mouse button. This is usually used for opening menus or lists of options.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_DESK3,"You can spin the wheel in the center of your mouse up and down to move the screen up and down when there's more than one screen of info in a program.
You can also click the wheel down to use the third mouse button, also called the <b>middle mouse button</b>. It's rarely used, and your mouse might not even have one.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_LAP1,"Laptops usually have what is called a <b>touchpad mouse</b> or just a <b>touchpad</b>. It can have buttons, or it might just have areas drawn on its surface that let you <b>left-click</b> and <b>right-click</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_LAP2,"If you don't have actual buttons on your touchpad, <b>clicking</b> means tapping on the touchpad, or pressing down until you hear a ""click."" When something tells you to <b>right-click</b>, you might have to press down with two fingers at once on the touchpad, or press the side of the touchpad - there's a lot of variation, take a minute to try it out.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_LAP3,Some touchpads support swiping with two fingers to scroll windows up and down. Try yours out and see!,dood,,,
TOURTEST_KB1,"Let's move on to the keyboard. You already know how to type all the normal keys, but in the future, you might need to type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + S</span></tt>, or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + (some other key)</span></tt>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_KB2,"When something asks you to type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + S</span></tt>, that means press and hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> (pronounced as ""Control""), then press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">S</span></tt>, then release both keys. You can hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> as long as you need to, but if you hold the other key for very long, it will repeat the command.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_KB3,"There are some other keys like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt>, and the key between <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt>, which is usually called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> or ""the <b>Windows</b> Key"". On most keyboards it looks like the <b>Windows</b> logo - A square made of 4 squares. The squares may or may not be wavy.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_KB_LAP,"You may also have a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Fn</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Function</span></tt> key. This key, when used with the <b>F Keys</b> (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">F1</span></tt>-<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">F12</span></tt>) on the top of your keyboard, will let you do things like turn your Wi-Fi on and off, adjusting screen brightness, changing the speaker volume, and more. Check your computer's manual for more information!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_KB_DESK,"Your keyboard might also have a square pad on the far right with a lot of numbers on it. These keys will type numbers if <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Num Lock</span></tt> is on (look for a little light at the top of the keyboard that will tell you if it's on or off), and will act as arrow keys or other keys if <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Num Lock</span></tt> is off. Usually you won't need these keys, but it's good to know!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_USE,"Ok, now that you know more about controlling your computer, let's learn how to use it!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_USE1,"The first thing to remember is that Endless OS is like any other computer - you can do anything you need to do, you just need to know <b>how</b> to do it.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_HOME1,"We'll start with what you can see right now. This is called the <b>Desktop</b>, it's where everything starts.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_HOME_MAC,"This isn't like you desktop on a Mac, you can't store files here - it's more like an extended <b>Dock</b>, or the <b>Launchpad</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_HOME_WIN,"This isn't like your Windows Desktop - You can't put files here, only Apps.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_HOME2,"Like your phone, if you install Apps, they show up on the grid here.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_DOCS,"You can get to your files by opening <b>Files</b>. You've already got pre-made folders for <b>Documents</b>, <b>Music</b>, <b>Pictures</b>, <b>Videos</b>, and more.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_TRASH_MAC,"You might be wondering where the Trash is - It's in <b>Files</b>. It works the same way - you can recover files you've deleted, or empty it out.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_TRASH_WIN,"You might be wondering where the Recycle Bin is - It's in <b>Files</b>, and it's called the Trash. It works the same way - you can recover files you've deleted, or empty it out.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_STARTMENU1,"You might also be wondering where the <b>Start Menu</b> is. In Endless, this is separated into two different things. To search files and programs, you can type what you're looking for into the <b>Search Bar</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_STARTMENU2,"To get a list of installed programs, you can open the <b>App Center</b> on the <b>Desktop</b> and click the <b>Installed</b> tab at the top.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SPOTLIGHT1,"If you're missing Spotlight, the <b>Search Bar</b> has the same ability to search all your programs and files.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SPOTLIGHT2,"If you're looking for the <b>Applications folder</b>, you can open the <b>App Center</b> from the <b>Desktop</b>, and click the <b>Installed</b> tab at the top.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_APPS1,"Now that you know the basics of the <b>Desktop</b>, let's talk about <b>Apps</b> and <b>files</b>!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_APPS2,<b>Apps</b> are how you run programs on Endless OS - we use a system called <b>Flatpak</b> that lets you download and install everything from a central location.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_APPS_NET,"Because you're connected to the internet, you can use the <b>App Center</b> to install new apps. ",dood,,,
TOURTEST_APPS_NONET,"You can't install any new apps if you're not connected to the internet, but you can still use the <b>App Center</b> to check what's already here for you to use.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_OPENWRITER,"Let's run an <b>App</b> right now - Find <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> on the <b>Desktop</b>, and click on it to launch it.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_TYPE,Let's type some text. You can type whatever you want!,dood,,,
TOURTEST_TYPE_MOVEBOX,"For the next few steps, we'll need to use controls in the upper-right of the screen, where this text box is! Don't worry - move your cursor to just over my first sentence, and click the little arrow there - It'll move this box to the bottom of the screen. Once you do that, we can keep going.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_FILE,"Now, move the cursor up to the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the screen and click it.
Then, move your cursor down the menu to <b>Save</b>, and click that.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SAVEDIALOG,"A new window will pop up. Type whatever you like in the <b>Name</b> space at the top, then click the blue <b>Save</b> button, or press <b>Enter</b> on your keyboard. Don't worry about where your file saved - we'll get to that soon.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_CLOSE,"Now, let's close <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> by clicking the <b>X</b> in the upper right-hand corner of the <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> window. ",dood,,,
TOURTEST_CLOSE_WIN,Closing a program works the same way in Endless OS and Windows - closing the window closes the program.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_CLOSE_MAC,"On a Mac, if you close a window, the program stays running. Here, on Endless OS, if you close the window, it closes the entire program.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_APPUSED,Great job! You successfully used an App!,dood,,,
TOURTEST_FILES,"OK, now let's find that file you just saved.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_OPENFILES,"Find <b>Files</b> on the <b>Desktop</b>, and <b>click</b> to open it.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_GOTODOCS,"Now we can see all your files! You might remember that when we saved our file in <b>LibreOffice Writer</b>, it went to a folder called <b>Documents</b> - and if you look in this window, there it is! <b>Double-click</b> <b>Documents</b> to open it.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_THEREITIS,"Look, there's your file!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_FINDBYNAME1,"There's another way to find that file, though. Close the <b>Documents</b> window by clicking the <b>X</b> in the upper-right corner. ",dood,,,
TOURTEST_FINDBYNAME2,What if you had no idea where to look for that file? What if you only remembered the name you used to save the file?,dood,,,
TOURTEST_USESEARCH,This is where the <b>Search Bar</b> comes in. Type your file name in the <b>Search Bar</b>.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_RESULTS,"Hopefully, you'll see just one entry in the results - that's your file! You might see more than one, but you can usually use the location below the name to figure out if it's the one you're looking for.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_OPENAGAIN,"If you click it that file in the results list, you'll open it, and now you can edit it again!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SEARCHLOTS,"You can search more than just files with the <b>Search Bar</b>, too. It can search the <b>Encyclopedia</b> App, and if you're connected to the internet, it can do a Google search for you as well.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS1,"Now, let's get into the inner workings of Endless OS, just a little - Let's learn about the <b>Settings</b> window!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS2,"The <b>Settings</b> window is how you control all the more detailed parts of Endless OS. Normally, you won't need to use this - but it's important you know where it is and what it does, just in case!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_TRAYICONS,Look in the bottom right corner of your screen - Do you see the icons to the left of the date and time? These icons are shortcuts for important information about your computer.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_MOVEWIN,"Also, if this text box is still in the bottom-right of the screen, you probably want to move it again - Just use the little arrow right on top of the first sentence!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_HASNET,"The icon on the left, the fan-shaped one, shows the strength of your connection to a Wi-Fi network - it's like the ""bars"" on your phone.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_NONET,"The left-most icon might look like a fan with a little X on it, or an airplane - either way, it means you're not connected to a Wi-Fi network.
(The airplane means ""airplane mode"" - all wireless connections turned off.)",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_TRAY_VOL,"The icon that looks like a little speaker gives you an idea of how loud your volume is. If you see a little X on it, that means your speakers or headphones are muted!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_LAP_BATT,"You'll also see a little icon that looks like a battery, and I think you can guess what that one means.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_TRAY_INFO,You can click on any of these icons to get more detailed information about them.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS8,"On the far right, in the corner, is a <b>circle</b> that has the initials of the name you put in back when you installed Endless OS.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS9,"<b>Click</b> the <b>circle</b>, and a menu will pop up. Then. <b>click</b> the entry in the menu named <b>Settings</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS10,"On the left side of the <b>Settings</b> window is a scrolling list of all the different things you can change - I know there are a lot, but you'll usually only need a few of them.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS11,"Some of the ones you might be interested in are visible already: <b>Wi-Fi</b>, <b>Background</b>, and <b>Power</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS12,"<b>Wi-Fi</b> controls your network connection, useful if you're trying to connect to a specific network, or trying to turn it off to save battery.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS13,"<b>Background</b> lets you set your desktop image to whatever you want. Change it to your favorite photo, if you like!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS14,<b>Power</b> lets you manage if your computer goes to sleep automatically if you aren't using it.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_LAP_PWR,"Because you have a laptop, you can have your power settings change, depending on whether your computer is plugged in or not. Very handy!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS15,"Take a look at more settings if you want, but you shouldn't have to change anything! Endless OS is set up to work correctly right out of the box.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING1,"Congratulations! I know that was a lot, thanks for staying all the way to the end!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING2,You now should know how to use Endless OS for most basic tasks!,dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING3,"Explore all the apps that are already installed, and check out what you can do with them. Here are some examples...",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING4,"<b>LibreOffice</b> is your go-to for anything that you might want to do with text, slideshows, spreadsheets, or diagrams. It's your replacement for Microsoft Office.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING5,"If you want to learn something, like geography, history, math, and other useful skills, check out <b>Kolibri</b> and the <b>Encyclopedia</b>!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING6,<b>GIMP</b> and <b>Krita</b> will let you do some Photoshop-quality art to impress all your friends.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING7,"You can watch DVDs, play videos on your computer, and listen to your music collection with <b>VLC</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING8,"And, of course, if you want to learn to code, create 3d art, or just learn more about Endless OS, you can try the Hack <b>Clubhouse</b>!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING9,I hope you have fun with Endless OS - See you around!,dood,,,
