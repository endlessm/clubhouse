BONUSROUND_QUESTION,Sidetrack was actually pretty fun. Want to go back there with me?,riley,,,
BONUSROUND_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure!,riley,,,
BONUSROUND_LAUNCH,A.maze.ing! Launch the *Sidetrack* app.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click the *Sidetrack* icon. ,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS1,"Soooo relieved to be out of that maze! It was beyond scary at times in there. I kind of want to go back in there! 

Don't judge me ;)  I enjoy a good challenge! Guessing you do too. Also I wouldn't have met that AI thing. */ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\*

I noticed some things I want to investigate. Like, I saw evidence of another key I can definitely use. 

If we get this key, we'll be able to hack the maze and make our own levels. Let's check it out!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS1_B,"Uh oh, first we have more levels to beat! And these are extra tricky! 

What is this, some kind of robot dance party!? And for this one, we can't even edit *Instructions*!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS1_B_HINT1,"Okay, we can't edit *Instructions*, but we _can_ still edit Units! And we can reorder the *Instructions*.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS1_B_HINT2,"Sometimes it's good to try out different solutions and see how far you can get. 

Then you go back in, figure out what's wrong, tweak some things, then try again. It's all part of it!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS2,Sweet! You nailed it! We should just be a few levels from finding that key! Fingers crossed. ,,hurray,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS2_B,"Now we have to beat THIS level, and the *Units* panel is locked!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS2_B_HINT1,I'm worried about all those *Robots* in column 7. There's got to be a way to get rid of some of them.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS2_B_HINT2,We can still edit *Instructions*. We don't have to use the ones they gave us. Let's just try a different order first.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS3,"Nice, this level has no restrictions! We can edit *Units* and *Instructions* all we want.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS3_HINT1,"Wanna hear a real cool trick? When I get to column 4, all of the *Robots* will be back to where they started. 

Knowing that makes it easier to predict where the *Robots* in those last 3 columns will show up.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4,"Whoa, this level is _out of control_. And we can't edit *Instructions*! Challenging! We'll need to reorder them.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4_HINT1,"We can't edit *Instructions*, so probably all we can do is rearrange the ones we've got.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4_HINT2,"I think the last *Instruction*, in position 7, has to be a `jump`, since there's a *Pit* right near the Exit.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4_HINT3,"The first Instruction, in column 0, doesn't have to be an `up`. Something else could work there too.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4_HINT4,"If we `push` a *Wall* with a *Pit* to its right, the *Wall* will fall into the *Pit*. Love that! Let's make sure we use that.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS4_HINT5,Just because we _can_ edit *Units* doesn't necessarily mean we _have_ to.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS5,"This level doesn't look too hard! But we can only reorder *Instructions*, not edit them.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS5_HINT1,"Hmm, `push` is a powerful *Instruction*, but it can't solve everything. Pushing a *Wall* isn't always the best option!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS5_HINT2,"`push` moves me forward. I can use it instead of a `forward` *Instruction*, even when I have nothing to `push` out of my way.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS5_HINT3,"I think we can tell what the final *Instruction* needs to be: `jump`. 

And to line up my `jump`, I somehow need to be right where that *Wall* is in column 6.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6,"You're really excellent at this. And persistent! Thanks to your help, we're almost there! I can sense the key ;) ",,hurray,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B,"Look at this weird level we have to beat. All the *Instructions* are missing! And the Units panel isn't even available, nice. ",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT1,We have to type all the *Instructions* in from scratch!,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT2,"Let's just try a solution, see how far we get, then tweak our solution based on what we observe, and then try again!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT3,"It's useful to remember that you can type *Instructions* in any order, then flip back over rearrange them.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT4,"I bet there's more than one way through this level. But pushing that middle block in column 2 seems like one approach. 

We may have to push it over and over.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7,"Oh cool, in this level we can use Unit editing AND *Instruction*  editing! It should be a breeze.

Wait, what? Are you seeing what I'm seeing? There's no way through a double thick column of *Walls*, is there? 

Not even `push` can solve THAT. What are we going to do?",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_B,Oh! Here it is! Guess what? I just found the Level Editing key! Just what we've been searching for! We did it!,,hurray,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_FLIP,"Flip the app around, then use the key to unlock the Level Editing panel!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE1,"Amazing! Exactly what I wanted! This is the code that creates this level!

See `add (pit, 1, 2);`? That's what creates the *Pit* right near the beginning. This code says: add a `pit` at coordinate (1,2).

Coordinate (1,2) means x = 1, y = 2. X is the column, so that's why the pit appears in column 1.

Y = 2 is for the row. The top row is y = 0, and the bottom row is y = 4. We hackers like to start counting from 0 instead of 1.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE2,"If we want to move that *Pit* out of our way, we can give it a new coordinate.

Try changing the coordinate to something like x = 1, y = 4 by editing the code to say `add (pit, 1, 4);`",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE3,"But we really need to do is fix the problem of two columns of *Walls* in a row! 

You know what's easiest? We can just delete some of them! Muah ha ha!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE3_HINT1,"See all the lines that say `add (wall, x, y);` and x is either 3 or 4? Those make all the *Walls* in columns 3 and 4. ",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE3_HINT2,Try deleting some of those lines to make it possible to finish the level. Then flip back to see how you did.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE3_HINT3,"Depending on how you edit the level, you MAY also need to edit *Instructions* so you can beat it.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS8,I LOVE editing the level! Remember how hard this robot dance party was? Now we can beat it EASY.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS8_HINT1,"Go the Level hacking panel and edit the code! Heck, you can just delete EVERY `add()` function if you want!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS8_HINT2,Don't delete `rileyPosition = 2;` and `goalPosition = 2;` though. You can always Reset the panel if you mess up.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS9,This out of control level got even MORE crowded. Madness! But edit the Level code and we'll finish it in no time.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS10,"This is it! We've arrived at the END!

A glorious blank canvas! Nothing here except what we decide to `add`.

Let's make our own level. Go to the Level panel and write your own code, and beat it to finish!",,hurray,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS10_B,Awesome! Stick with me here and I'll teach everything I know about making your own level.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS10_B_HINT1,"`rileyPosition = 2;` and `goalPosition = 2;` say which Y coordinate, meaning which ROW, me and the goal start on. 

You can change both numbers. 0 to 4!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS10_B_HINT2,"Below that type `add (wall, 2, 4);`. Or whatever you want to add: `wall`, `pit`, `robotA`, `robotB`.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS10_B_HINT3,"Remember that the two numbers are x for column and y for row. 

`add (wall, 2, 4);` means add a *Wall*at x = 2 and y = 4. I usually just try different numbers or use graph paper.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS10_B_HINT4,"Add a bunch of stuff, then flip the app around and test it out! Edit the *Instructions* too! 

See if your friend can beat your level!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS10_B_HINT5,"When I have a level I really like, I will sometimes copy and paste the level code into a text document so I can never lose it. 

Check out the little Gedit icon in the bottom left.",,,,
BONUSROUND_SUCCESS,"Good luck beating your own level! Keep editing it to make it more interesting. 

You can always go back and change any of the earlier levels too. Have fun!",riley,hurray,,
BONUSROUND_ABORT,"Okay but trust me, it's gonna be cool. Come back when you have more time!",riley,,,
