POWERUPB2_QUESTION,Now for our next Power-up. Hope you like fireworks!,Saniel,,,
POWERUPB2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Of course!,,,,
POWERUPB2_LAUNCH,Excellent. Launch Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPB2_EXPLAIN,"We're going to add code so a Power-up of type `blowup` blows up every enemy on the screen.

This is very similar to the other one. Click the Flip button.",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE,"See the `activatePowerup()` function in the Power-ups tab? The `invulnerable` Power-up makes us invulnerable. 

Now we want to add a setting for Power-up `blowup`. So if we pick up one of these, we blow up everything.

See how there's an `if (powerUpType === invulnerable)` check already? You will add a similar one for Power-up `blowup`.

Then instead of setting `ship.invulnerableTimer = 5;` you will use `blowUpEnemies();`.",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE_HINT1,"Just before the final `}` on the last line, type in `if (powerUpType === blowup)`",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE_HINT2,And then `blowUpEnemies();`. And that should do it. Test it out.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Play the level to test it.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Click that handy *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPB2_PLAY_AGAIN,"Let's give it another go, shall we?",,,,
POWERUPB2_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Press *Restart.*,,,,
POWERUPB2_PLAYTEST,Let's see what happens when you pick up both kinds of Power-ups.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ONLYONE,All Power-ups seem to be doing the same thing.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ONLYONE_HINT1,Go back and make sure we have the two `if` statements.,,,,
POWERUPB2_FINISHLEVEL,Major fireworks! Go ahead and finish the level now with the help of the Power-ups!,,,,
POWERUPB2_NOT_ACTIVATED,"Hmm, these Power-ups don't seem to have any powers! Go back and see what you can do.",,,,
POWERUPB2_SUCCESS,"Excellent. Okay, only one more Power-up before we can get our next fob to open the box. ",,,,
POWERUPB2_ONE_PICKED,"One picked, can you pick the other kind?.",,,,
POWERUPB2_OTHER_PICKED,Did you mean to pick the other type? You can go pick that one now. ,,,,
POWERUPB2_NOT_PICKED,You couldn't pick any Power-up? Are you aure they are being spawned? Maybe check on that. ,,,,
POWERUPB2_ABORT,"No problem, we can try it again later. ",,,,
