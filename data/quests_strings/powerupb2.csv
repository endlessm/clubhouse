POWERUPB2_QUESTION,Now for our last powerup. Ready for some fireworks?,Saniel,,,
POWERUPB2_QUEST_ACCEPT,You bet!,,,,
POWERUPB2_LAUNCH,Excellent. Launch Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPB2_EXPLAIN,"We're going to add code so a powerup of type `'blowup'` blows up every enemy on the screen.

Click  the Flip button.",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE,"This is very similar to the other one. Click on the Powerups tab. See the `activatePowerup()` function?

Right now, the type `'invulnerable'` powerup makes us invulnerable. 

Now we want to add a setting for powerup `'blowup'`.  So if we pick up one of these, we blow up everything.

See how there's an `if (powerUpType == 'invulnerable')` check already. Add a similar one for powerup `'blowup'`.

You can blow up everything with the function `blowUpEnemies()`.",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE_HINT1,"So after the code that's there already, you should have `if (powerUpType == 'blowup')`",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE_HINT2,And then `blowUpEnemies();`. And that should do it. Test it out.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Play the level to test it.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPB2_PLAY_AGAIN,Let's try again.,,,,
POWERUPB2_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPB2_PLAYTEST,Let's see what happens when you pick up both kinds of powerups.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ONLYONE,All powerups seem to be doing the same thing.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ONLYONE_HINT1,Go back and make sure we have the two `if` statements.,,,,
POWERUPB2_FINISHLEVEL,Major fireworks! Go ahead and finish the level now with the help of the powerups!,,,,
POWERUPB2_NOT_ACTIVATED,"Hmm, these powerups aren't doing anything. Go back and check.",,,,
POWERUPB2_SUCCESS,"Excellent. Okay, only one more powerup before we can get our next fob to open the box. ",,,,
POWERUPB2_ONE_PICKED,"One picked, can you pick the other kind?.",,,,
POWERUPB2_OTHER_PICKED,Hmm you picked the wrong type.,,,,
POWERUPB2_NOT_PICKED,You couldn't pick any powerup? Are they being spawned?,,,,
POWERUPB2_ABORT,"No problem, we can try it again later. ",,,,
