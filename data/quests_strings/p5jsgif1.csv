P5JSGIF1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Let's load up some cool animated gifs as a start to our animated art piece!
",,,,
P5JSGIF1_1,"Welcome, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Today, we'll be learning how to make a <b>collage</b> out of animated GIFs. If you've never made a <b>collage</b>, don't worry - it's a type of art made by sticking a big collection of different things together.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_2,"<b>p5.js</b> has a live online editor we can use - If it doesn't open automatically, use this link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4""><a href=""https://editor.p5js.org/"">https://editor.p5js.org/</a></span></u>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_3,"Every p5.js sketch has 2 main parts, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> - You’ve seen these before in other p5.js activities. <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> runs once, at the beginning, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> runs continuously until the program is stopped.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_4,"First off, let’s make our working area a little bigger. <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> is where we create the <b>canvas</b>, the place where all our GIFs will show up. Right now, it’s only 400 pixels by 400 pixels. I think we need more room!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_5,"Let’s change <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">createCanvas(400,400);</span></tt> to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">createCanvas(600,600);</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_6,"If you pressed <b>Play</b> right now, you’d see our new, larger canvas – but we still have a lot to do. Let’s find some GIFs to use!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_7,"Open a new tab or window for your web browser, and go to <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4""><a href=""http://giphy.com"">http://giphy.com</a></span></u> (or click the link!)",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_8,"Search for something you want in your collage, and then click on one of those GIFs in the search results.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_9,"On the page for that GIF, click the <b>Copy Link</b> button, which should make a box with 3 different links pop up..",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_10,"Select and copy the middle one, the “GIF Link”, then go back to the p5.js web editor.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_11,"Let’s store this GIF in our sketch so we can use it later in the code. At the very top of the sketch, before <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt>, we need to create a new <b>function</b>.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_12,"At the very top, on line 1, type: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">function preload() {</span></tt> (press <b>Enter</b> twice for 2 new lines) <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">}</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_13,"There’s our new <b>function</b>. When we put it into another part of the program, it will do whatever we write between the curly braces ( {} ).",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_14,"Of course, there’s nothing in there right now! Let’s fix that. On the blank line between the 2 curly braces ( {} ), type: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">gif1 = loadImage(“</span></tt> (paste in the address of the GIF that you copied) <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">”);</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_15,"So, for example, mine looks like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">gif1 = loadImage(""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4""><a href=""https://media.giphy.com/media/11StaZ9Lj74oCY/giphy.gif"">https://media.giphy.com/media/11StaZ9Lj74oCY/giphy.gif</a></span></u>"");</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_16,"Now we need to show the image. Inside the curly braces ( {} ) for the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> function, on the line <b>after</b> <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background(...</span></tt>, type this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">image(gif1, 0, 0);</span></tt> This “adds” the image to the canvas and displays it, using the name that we gave the GIF in the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">preload()</span></tt> function.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_17,"Now, if you run your code, you should see your GIF! Cool, right?",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_18,"Next time, we’ll learn to do even more things with the GIFs, like play and pause them. See you then!",daemon,,,
