FIZZICSKEY_QUESTION,Are you ready to go recover that key from the most ancient levels in Fizzics?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_QUEST_ACCEPT,Always ready for Fizzics!,,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LAUNCH,Launch *Fizzics*!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1,"Okay, here's the situation. I stashed the key back in the dark ages when Fizzics was brand new.

It didn't even have the hacking panel back then. And Fizzics isn't backward compatible.

Basically what I'm saying is that we can't hack directly to solve these levels. 

We have to do it a clunkier way. Let's get started. It's easier to demonstrate than explain.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_B,"Right now this level is in suspended animation. It's been inactive for so long. 

Okay, so just let me make a few adjustments over here to get everything moving again. 

Are you ready?",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_C,"Okay! So that didn't work. We need get the orange ball to touch the goal, 

This configuration doesn't accomplish that. See how there's no Fling tool and no Drag tool?

Hardly any of the tools worked back when this level was made. All you have is the *Add* tool. 

And you can only *Add* boulders! It's that ancient! 

",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_READY,"Use the *Add* tool to *Add* boulders until you think the level is in a good configuration. 

Tell me when you're ready.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q1,"Great, I'll take the level out of suspended animation. 

Just a couple more questions. What should the friction on the orange ball be?",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q1_A1,Low.,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q1_A2,None!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q2,And how bouncy should the organge ball be?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q2_A1,Only a little.,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q2_A2,MAXIMUM BOUNCY!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_GO,Okay here we go!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_FAIL,"Hmmm... guess that configuration wasn't quite right. 

Nothing to do but try it again with a modified solution.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_FINISH,"Great job! You succeeded, even with a very limited set of tools.

Don't get TOO excited, though. We have a ways to go, still.",Saniel,hurray,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2,"Here's the next level. We have to get through all six!

This one is very much like the last, except the orange ball isn't bouncy.

I can control a couple things from here. I can make the orange ball and spikey things repel each other. 

And I can give the orange ball some friction.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_READY,"Use the *Add* tool to *Add* boulders until you think the level is in a good configuration. 

Tell me when you're ready.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_Q1,Do you want the the spikey balls to repel the orange balls?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_Q1_A1,Yes,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_Q1_A2,No,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_Q2,Should the orange ball have any friction?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_Q2_A1,A little,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_Q2_A2,None,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_GO,Let's try it out!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_FAIL,"Curses! Well, let's try adding different boulders, or perhaps we can add different settings to the available parameters?",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_FINISH,Sensational! I'm pleased to see your skill and accumen at this task.,Saniel,hurray,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3,"On this level, the orange ball can either have *positive* or *negative* gravity. 

With negative gravity intstead of dropping downwards, the ball floats upwards. 

Also note the two goals are overlapping. As soon as the level starts, they will fly away from each other!

Also, you'll see that the diamonds tend to clump together. That's because of their attraction setting!",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_READY,Use the *Add* tool to add boulders until you think the level is in a good configuration. Tell me when you're ready.,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_Q1,Should the orange ball have positive or negative gravity?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_Q1_A1,Positive,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_Q1_A2,Negative,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_Q2,Also if you'd like I can make diamonds be repelled by boulders. That might be interesting.,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_Q2_A1,Yes,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_Q2_A2,No,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_GO,Let's try it out!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_FAIL,"Blast. Well it's rare to get something right without trying a few times. 

So-called failure can be a great teacher! Let's attempt it again.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_FINISH,Aha! A worthy solution!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4,"This is another level in which the goal is mobile. That boulder is about to send it flying! 

Here's a nice thing though. All the diamonds are attracted to the orange ball! Very handy!

Let's see... I can give gravity to the goal and the diamonds, if you'd like.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_READY,"Use the *Add* tool to add boulders until you think the level is in a good configuration. 

Tell me when you're ready.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q1,Do you want the goal object to have any gravity?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q1_A1,Yes,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q1_A2,No,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q2,How about the diamonds. Do you want them to have gravity?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q2_A1,Yes,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q2_A2,No,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q3,"Okay, hmm. These diamonds are bouncy. Do you want them to have friction?",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q3_A1,Yes,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q3_A2,No,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_GO,Let's see how that worked!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_FAIL,"What a bother. But no worries, let's try again.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_FINISH,You never fail to impress! Just two more levels to go!,Saniel,hurray,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5,"This time the orange ball is all set to launch like a catapult! 

That should be fun. Watch out, though, it's VERY bouncy!

I can give the goal gravity if you'd like. Hmmm look at this! I can also make the diamonds HUGE!",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_READY,"Use the *Add* tool to *Add* boulders until you think the level is in a good configuration. 

Tell me when you're ready.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_Q1,Do you want the goal to have gravity?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_Q1_A1,Yes,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_Q1_A2,No,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_Q2,Should the diamonds be HUGE?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_Q2_A1,Yes,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_Q2_A2,No,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_GO,Here we go!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_FAIL,Alas! Well it was an excellent attempt. Let's get back in and try again.,Saniel,talk_anger,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_FINISH,"Nailed it! Excellent, we're ready for the final level! We'll recover that key soon enough!",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6,"The key is here! We just need to beat the level! This one is peculiar however.

The goal has normal gravity. But the orange ball has NEGATIVE gravity. 

I can increase its negative gravity to cause it to fall upwards with greater force.

If you'd like, I can also cause boulders to repel the orange ball.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_READY,"Use the *Add* tool to add boulders until you think the level is in a good configuration. 

Tell me when you're ready.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_Q1,How much negative gravity should the orange ball have?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_Q1_A1,Some,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_Q1_A2,Lots!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_Q2,Should the orange ball be repelled by boulders?,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_Q2_A1,Yes,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_Q2_A2,No,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_GO,Let's hope this works!,Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6_FAIL,"This level seems quite the challenge. Don't fret, however. Let's just try again.",Saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_SUCCESS,"You are unstoppable! That task required a great deal of creativity, and you came through. 

And Voila! Here is the key we need!",Saniel,hurray,,
FIZZICSKEY_ABORT,"Come back when you're ready! Until then, Riley's stuck inside the maze! ",Saniel,,,
