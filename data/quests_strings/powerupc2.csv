POWERUPC2_QUESTION,Let's do some more work on that Power-up.,Saniel,,,
POWERUPC2_QUEST_ACCEPT,I'm ready,,,,
POWERUPC2_LAUNCH,Launch Lightspeed now.,,,,
POWERUPC2_EXPLAIN,"We're going to make it so Power-up `upgrade' doesn't always shrink the ship: It gives a random bonus!

Let's go to the code panel and I'll explain it there.",,,,
POWERUPC2_CODE,"Alright, start by clicking the Power-up tab and looking for the `activatePowerup()` function.

See where we left off with the `if (powerUpType === upgrade)`? We now want to pick a bonus at random.

Either we'll shrink the ship as before, or we'll increase the astronaut attraction with `ship.attractTimer = 5;`

We'll make a random number between 1 and 2, like this: `var r = random(1, 2);`. Then check it with `if`. Ready for hints?",,,,
POWERUPC2_CODE_HINT1,"After `if (powerUpType === upgrade)` type in a `{`. Then on the next line type `var r=random(1,2);`",,,,
POWERUPC2_CODE_HINT2,"On the next line after that type: `if (r === 1) ship.shrinkTimer = 5;` If you already see part of that, maybe you only need to type in the `if (r === 1)` part.",,,,
POWERUPC2_CODE_HINT3,And on the next line type `if (r === 2) ship.attractTimer = 5;`   And on the next line just `}`,,,,
POWERUPC2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Play the level now.,,,,
POWERUPC2_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press *Restart.* ,,,,
POWERUPC2_PLAY_AGAIN,Let's play the level again.,,,,
POWERUPC2_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Press *Restart.* ,,,,
POWERUPC2_PLAYTEST,And let's see if we get both effects with those Power-ups.,,,,
POWERUPC2_ONLYONE,"Hmmm. You're picking up Power-ups, but there's only one effect. Let's go back to the code to fix that.",,,,
POWERUPC2_NO_UPGRADE,That Power-up didn't give any upgrade to the ship. Go back and see if an upgrade is specified.,,,,
POWERUPC2_OTHER_PICKED,Did you mean to pick a Power-up of a different type?,,,,
POWERUPC2_NOT_PICKED,"Alright, start by clicking the Power-up tab and looking for the `activatePowerup()` function.

See where we left off with the `if (powerUpType === upgrade)`? We now want to pick a bonus at random.

Either we'll shrink the ship as before, or we'll increase the astronaut attraction with `ship.attractTimer = 5;`

We'll make a random number between 1 and 2, like this: `var r = random(1, 2);`. Then check it with `if`. Ready for hints?",,,,
POWERUPC2_FINISHLEVEL,"Yes, that's it. Finish the level now.",,,,
POWERUPC2_SUCCESS,Perfect. One more tweak to this Power-up and then we'll be ready to get the fob.,,hurray,,
POWERUPC2_ABORT,No prob. We can complete this later. ,,,,
