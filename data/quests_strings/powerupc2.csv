POWERUPC2_QUESTION,Let's do some more work on that powerup.,Saniel,,,
POWERUPC2_QUEST_ACCEPT,I'm ready,,,,
POWERUPC2_LAUNCH,Launch Lightspeed now.,,,,
POWERUPC2_EXPLAIN,"We're going to make it so powerup `'upgrade'` doesn't always shrink the ship: It gives a random bonus!

Let's go to the code panel and I'll explain it there.",,,,
POWERUPC2_CODE,"All right, start by clicking on the Powerup tab and looking for the `activatePowerup()` function.

See where we left off with the `if (powerUpType == 'upgrade')` from last time? We're going to expand on that.

Once we know we're touching a powerup of type `'upgrade'`, we want to pick an upgrade at random.

Either shrinking the ship like we already did, or increasing the astronaut attraction with `ship.attractTimer = 5;`

First create a variable with a random number between 1 and 2 like this `var r = random(1, 2);`

Then you can use `if` statements to do one upgrade or the other.",,,,
POWERUPC2_CODE_HINT1,"After `if (powerUpType == 'upgrade') {` generate a random number `var r = random(1, 2);`",,,,
POWERUPC2_CODE_HINT2,Then use that to do one thing or another: `if (r == 1) ship.shrinkTimer = 5;`...,,,,
POWERUPC2_CODE_HINT3,`if (r == 2) ship.attractTimer = 5;`,,,,
POWERUPC2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Play the level now.,,,,
POWERUPC2_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPC2_PLAY_AGAIN,Let's try again.,,,,
POWERUPC2_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPC2_PLAYTEST,And let's see if we get both effects with those powerups...,,,,
POWERUPC2_ONLYONE,"You're picking up powerups, but there's only one effect. Let's go back to the code to fix it.",,,,
POWERUPC2_NO_UPGRADE,That powerup didn't gave any upgrade to the ship. Go back and check if upgrades are given..,,,,
POWERUPC2_OTHER_PICKED,Seems you picked a powerup of a different type.,,,,
POWERUPC2_NOT_PICKED,You couldn't pick any powerup? Are they actually being spawned?,,,,
POWERUPC2_FINISHLEVEL,"Yes, that's it. Finish the level now.",,,,
POWERUPC2_SUCCESS,Perfect. One more tweak to this powerup and then we'll be ready to get the code.,,hurray,,
POWERUPC2_ABORT,No prob. We can complete this later. ,,,,
