RILEYSLEVELS_QUESTION,Hey there! I'm heading up the search for fob #1. It's hidden in Fizzics. Want to join me?,Ada,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_QUESTION_ACCEPT,Of course!,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LAUNCH,"Fantastic. We really need your help! Saniel told me Riley designed some hidden Fizzics levels. 

She made them as a Fizzics assignment for Saniel and he implemented them so we can play them. 

Let's play them now, and for Riley's sake, let's hope luck is with us! Launch Fizzics and let's go!",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_GETTOLEVEL11,"First, you need to get to level 11.",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LEVEL11,Here we are at level 11! We need to pass this one to get to Riley's secret levels. ,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LEVEL11_HINT1,"Remember: To beat a level, you need to fling all the orange balls into the target.",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LEVEL11_HINT2,The balls with the stars are the goals. Maybe you should add one of those!,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LEVEL11_HINT3,Click the Flip button and click on the *Add* tool to enable it.,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_ALREADYBEAT,Oh hey! You already finished Riley's levels!,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LEVEL12,"Great. You made it into Riley's secret levels! Now, see if you can beat them all.",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_DIED_LEVEL12,Ooopf. What's up with those balls falling to the bottom?,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_DIED_LEVEL12_HINT1,Changing the gravity variable might be very advisable right now.,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_START_LEVEL13,"Wait, what? Riley deactivated the *Fling* tool? How can you solve this problem without it?",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_START_LEVEL13_HINT1,"You know by now, flip the app and find another way to make the goal touch the orange ball!",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_DIED_LEVEL13,"That was a good thought, but try another solution.",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_DIED_LEVEL13_HINT1,What if you unfreeze the goal?,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_DIED_LEVEL13_HINT2,Maybe add gravity to the goal?,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_START_LEVEL14,"So, the sitch is you can fling in this level, but now the goal is blocked.",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_START_LEVEL15,"No *Fling* tool again, how can you solve this?",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_START_LEVEL16,"Great. Now you have the *Fling* tool, but there's something up with the Attractions sliders. ",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_NOMOVING,"Smart strategy, but it won't work. Riley programmed it so you can only win with the *Fling* tool.",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_SUCCESS,"You did it! That was really clever work! 

Oh, brilliant! I think we lucked upon one of those fobs we're looking for! Meet me at the Clubhouse!",,hurray,,
RILEYSLEVELS_ABORT,"OK, let's keep exploring this later. ",,,,
