LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_QUESTION,Ready for your next coding assignment?,Saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Of course!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_LAUNCH,Launch Lightspeed.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_EXPLAIN,I'd like you to add the enemies for Level 7. But this time we should have *two* different kinds of enemies at once.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_EXPLAIN_HINT1,You should go to the code view as usual.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab and look for the `spawnEnemy()` function as usual.

Whenever it's time to spawn an enemy make sure to return two kinds of enemies: *asteroid*, *spinner*, or *squid*.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT1,How do you pick one random number? That's right: the `random()` function.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT2,"And how do use it to pick one of two things? We could do `random(1,2)`.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT3,And all of that in an `if` statement to pick one enemy or the other.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT4,"So when it's time to spawn: 
`if (random(1,2) == 1) { return 'asteroid'; }
return 'squid';`",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT5,All of that after `if (ticksSinceSpawn > 40) {...}` of course.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT6,Make sure you go back and test your code in the game!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Let's test the level now.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_PLAYING,Let's see if we get *two* types of enemies.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_NOENEMIES,Hmmm. No enemies at all! Are you sure you spawned some? Go back and check.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_SOMENEMIES,We're missing some enemy types. Go back and make sure to spawn at least *two* types.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_FINISHLEVEL,That solution is correct. Now beat the level.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_SUCCESS,"Well done. Perhaps you could use a 
*hush gasket*.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_END,"I think you'll find this quite useful in your studies. It's amazing how many things call for a hush gasket. 

You're always making things so I figured you could use one! ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_ABORT,Okay. Just check back later when you're ready to do some more work on Lightspeed!,,,,
