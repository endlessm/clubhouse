We're going to create a new level using every enemy and every powerup Lightspeed can give us.

So, if all goes well, we'll find that second fob deep in Lightspeed!  Let's launch Lightspeed now!

Let's go to the coding panel and see what we can do! ",,,,

POWERUPA1_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab. See that `spawnPowerup()` function? That's what creates powerups.

The Spawn tab gives you a number with the type of powerup. `null` means no powerup.
