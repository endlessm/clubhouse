POWERUPA1_QUESTION,Ready to retrieve the next encoded fob from Lightspeed?,saniel,,,
POWERUPA1_QUEST_ACCEPT,"Yes, let's get to work!",,,,
POWERUPA1_LAUNCH,"Excellent. So we need to stay sharp and give this our keenest attention. 

We're going to create a new level using every enemy and every Power-up Lightspeed can give us.

So, if all goes well, we'll find that second fob deep in Lightspeed! Let's launch Lightspeed now!",,,,
POWERUPA1_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click on the Lightspeed icon on the desktop.        ,,,,
POWERUPA1_EXPLAIN,"Okay, let's make some Power-ups! Power-ups are capsules that give your ship special powers.

Very handy indeed! Let's go to the coding panel and see what these special powers can do! ",,,,
POWERUPA1_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPA1_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab. See that `spawnPowerup()` function? That's what creates Power-ups.

It creates the type of Power-up you return. For example, `return null;` means _no_ Power-up. 

So now, let's replace `return null;` with `return invulnerable;` and try the level.",,,,
POWERUPA1_CODE_HINT1,Change `return null;` to `return invulnerable;` Then try the level.,,,,
POWERUPA1_ABOUTTOPLAY,Start playing the level.,,,,
POWERUPA1_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press *Restart.* ,,,,
POWERUPA1_PLAY_AGAIN,Let's try that level again.,,,,
POWERUPA1_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Press *Restart*.,,,,
POWERUPA1_PLAYTEST,"Let's see if the Power-ups show up. When they first show up, they won't have any powers yet.",,,,
POWERUPA1_NOPOWERUPS,How strange. Looks like we have ZERO Power-ups. Something's wrong. Let's go back and check.,,,,
POWERUPA1_OTHER_POWERUP,"Intriguing! You spawned a Power-up, but it's a different kind. Have a look at your settings again.",,,,
POWERUPA1_FINISHLEVEL,"Excellent. The Power-ups are there, but they don't do anything yet. Finish the level now.",,,,
POWERUPA1_SUCCESS,Great. Your Lightspeed coding skills are still quite sharp.,,hurray,,
POWERUPA1_ABORT,Check back later and we can keep exploring. ,,,,
