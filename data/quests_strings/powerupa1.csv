POWERUPA1_QUESTION,Ready to retrieve the encoded fob from Lightspeed?,Saniel,,,
POWERUPA1_QUEST_ACCEPT,"Yes, let's get to work!",,,,
POWERUPA1_LAUNCH,"Excellent. So we need to stay sharp and give this our keenest attention. 

We're going to create a new level using every enemy and every powerup Lightspeed can give us.

So, if all goes well, we'll find that second fob deep in Lightspeed!  Let's launch Lightspeed now!

",,,,
POWERUPA1_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click on the Lightspeed icon on the desktop.	,,,,
POWERUPA1_EXPLAIN,"Okay, let's make some powerups! Powerups are capsules that give your ship special powers.

Let's go to the coding panel and see what we can do! ",,,,
POWERUPA1_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPA1_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab. See that `spawnPowerup()` function? That's what creates powerups.

The Spawn tab gives you a number with the type of powerup. `null` means no powerup. 

Return `'invulnerable'` and try the level.",,,,
POWERUPA1_CODE_HINT1,Set `return 'invulnerable';` and play the level.,,,,
POWERUPA1_ABOUTTOPLAY,Start playing the level.,,,,
POWERUPA1_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPA1_PLAY_AGAIN,Oh! The ship crashed while I was waiting for a powerup!,,,,
POWERUPA1_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Let's try again.,,,,
POWERUPA1_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT2,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPA1_PLAYTEST,"Let's see if the powerups show up. When they show up, they won't have any of their powers yet.",,,,
POWERUPA1_NOPOWERUPS,How strange. Looks like we have ZERO powerups. Something is wrong. Let's go back and check.,,,,
POWERUPA1_OTHER_POWERUP,"Oh interesting! A powerup was spawned, but not the kind we are looking for.",,,,
POWERUPA1_OTHER_POWERUP_HINT1,Flip the app again and edit the code to spawn a powerup of the `'invulnerable'` kind.,,,,
POWERUPA1_FINISHLEVEL,"Excellent. The powerups are there, although they don't do anything yet. Finish the level now.",,,,
POWERUPA1_SUCCESS,"Great. Your Lightspeed skills are still quite sharp. 

Come back later and let's keep working on that powerup.",,hurray,,
POWERUPA1_ABORT,Check back later and we can keep exploring. ,,,,
