P5JSVARINTRO1_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In the first part of this activity, you'll learn how to use variables to make P5JS even easier!",,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_1,"Hey, <b>{{user_name}}</b>. Today I want to show you something awesome that I just learned!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_2,"First things first - Let's start by opening the editor: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org</span></u> (if you don't have it already opened). Also, login if you can. If you can't, no worries!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_3,"Before we learn about <b>variables</b>, let us start by setting up our canvas. We will do this by adding a square into the 'draw()' function. Also, just like before we'll make the shape follow your mouse!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_4,"To get the rectangle to follow your mouse you'll type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">rect(mouseX, mouseY, 20, 20);</span></tt> right below <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background(255);</span></tt> on <b>line 7</b>. If you hit play, you should see a white box following your mouse. ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_5,"Next, we will give the shape some color with fill(). To do this start a new line right above rect(), and type 'fill('blue');'. When you hit play, you should notice the square turned blue.   ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_6,"However, if we wanted to use a set color for everything in our sketch, this is where <b>variables</b> would come in handy!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_7,"For this sketch we will place our <b>variable</b> above the 'setup()' function on line 1. Go to line 1 in your sketch and type 'x = 'blue''. By doing this you are letting the sketch know that wherever you put x, you actually mean the color 'blue'. ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_8,"This next part will make things a little more clear. Go to the line that says 'fill('blue');' and delete 'blue' and type 'x' in its place, then play the sketch!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_9,"Isn't that awesome? <b>Variables</b> can be a placeholder text or numbers. Here's a fun fact! If the program has a variable is set equal to a text, that text is called a 'string'.  ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_10,"So far, so good.  I just want to show you one more thing with <b>variables</b>, that might be helpful. If you haven't noticed, our square still has a black outline. I want to show you how we can use the <b>variable</b> we created to get rid of that outline.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_11,"This black outline is controlled through the use of stroke();. That means if we type in 'stroke(x)' a line above fill(x);, the outline color will change to the color we have the <b>variable</b>, x,  set too. ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_12,Now you'll see the square is all blue. Great job! But what if we wanted the stroke to be a different color from the fill?,daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_13,We can change the outline color by adding another <b>variable</b> with a new color set to it. Let's go ahead and practice that!,daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_14,Under our first <b>variable</b> x = 'blue';  go ahead and create a new line and type 'y = 'white';'.,daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_15,"Now, when you play the sketch, the outside of our square is white. Isn't that cool? As you can see <b>variables</b> can be super helpful and make a programmers life easier! ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_16,Go ahead and select <b>File</b> and then <b>Save</b> at the top left corner. If you don't have an account just copy and paste your code on a text document to save it. ,daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_17,"Phew, now that we got the basics of <b>variables</b> down, next time I'll show you how to create random colors using <b>variables</b>!
 Bye for now!",daemon3,,,
