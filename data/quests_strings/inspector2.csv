INSPECTOR2_QUEST_NAME,The Inspector Becomes The Inspected,,,,
INSPECTOR2_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
INSPECTOR2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Ada shows you some more cool tricks for the Inspector! (Part 2),,,,
INSPECTOR2_1,"Hello again, <b>{{user_name}}</b>. Ready to do some more webpage hacking with the Inspector?",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_2,"Let's dive right in - I'll launch your browser, just point it to <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://hack-computer.com/about</span></u> then open that Inspector gadget (Ctrl + Shift + I).",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_3,"Here we are again! Activate the <b>Select Element</b> button in the <b>top left corner of the Inspector</b>. Remember, it looks like an arrow pointing at a box.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_4,"Click on any of the images in the page, and notice that the Inspector will highlight the line that adds that image to the page. It should start with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img...</span></tt> and then at some point later in the tag, it should have  <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">src=""...""</span></tt> - you can read that as ""source"".",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_5,"Let's replace that image. To do that, we need to change the address inside the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">src=""...""</span></tt> part of the tag to a different 'source' address.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_6,"In the Inspector, double-click on the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">src</span></tt> text - be careful not to click the link to the actual image. Hit delete to erase the text, and then replace it with <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u> (Press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Enter</span></tt> when you're done).",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_7,"Perfect. Hey, Felix, come check out what <b>{{user_name}}</b> just did!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_8,"<i>Prrrowrrr, nyan!</i>
<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;Felix looks pleased.&gt;</span></tt>",felixnet,,,
INSPECTOR2_9,I knew he'd like it. The approval of a cat is always a good thing to have.,ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_10,"Let's try something you might already know, but from a different angle. Use the <b>Element Selector</b> to select “We're teaching a mindset."" (The popup over the text when you mouse over it should say <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">span</span></tt>). How you could make that text orange? If you have an idea, give it a try!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_11,"Here's how I'd do it - Once you've selected that text using the <b>Element Selector</b>, look in the Inspector pane, at the highlighted text.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_12,"I definitely recognize some of the code in there, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">style=...</span></tt> should look famillar. Let's change the color to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">color:orange;</span></tt>.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_13,"What you're doing is changing the page code behind the scenes - you're rewriting the webpage on the fly! Try changing that color to a hex color, like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">#76EECF</span></tt>. ",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_14,"Nice work! You can do that with text in any webpage - Who knows, maybe someone hid some text by making it the same color as the background.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_15,"Next, let’s try hacking a link. Try finding a link using the <b>Element Selector</b>. Remember, a link can be attached to text, buttons, images, videos, almost anything.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_16,"If you're having trouble finding a link, try selecting the ""Get Now"" button (not the text in the button, the button itself).",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_17,"When you've found a link and selected it with the <b>Element Selector</b>, the Inspector should highlight some code that starts with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;a...</span></tt> What we want is the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">href=""...""</span></tt> part of the tag, which controls where the link goes.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_18,"When you've found it, double-click on <b>href</b>, delete the text in between the quotes, and replace it with <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://www.nyan.cat</span></u>",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_19,"OK, now you can close the Inspector. Let's test your hacked link, by clicking the Get Now button.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_20,"See, Felix? I told you that <b>{{user_name}}</b> knew what you liked!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_21,"<i>Brbrbrbr...</i>
<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;Felix puffs himself up and purrs quietly.&gt;</span></tt>",felixnet,,,
INSPECTOR2_22,"Well, looks like you scored 10/10 in Felix's book, <b>{{user<i>name}}</b>. I'd say that's a _purrrfect</i> score. <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">::&gt;^_^&lt;::</span></tt> See you later!",ada,,,
