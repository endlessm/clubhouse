LIGHTSPEED_LAUNCH,First let's launch Lightspeed.,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click on the Lightspeed icon on the desktop.	,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_LEVELS1,"Okay, this isn’t going to be easy.  We have to get through the next 5 levels.

They’re all SUPER HARD for different reasons.  You won’t be able to see all the Topics either!

But when you see a Topic, you can hack the code however you want.

I recommend you try each level out first so you know why it’s hard.

Then when you flip to the coding panels, I can give you some hints on what to change.",,,,
LIGHTSPEED_LEVELS1_HINT1,Play this level to see why it's hard. Then flip to hack.,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_LEVELS2,"Good work!  One level down, four to go!",,,,
LIGHTSPEED_LEVELS2_HINT1,Play this level to see why it's hard. Then flip to hack.,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_LEVELS3,"Good work!  Two levels down, three to go!",,,,
LIGHTSPEED_LEVELS3_HINT1,Play this level to see why it's hard. Then flip to hack.,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_LEVELS4,"Good work!  Three level down, two to go!",,,,

LIGHTSPEED_PANEL_LOCKED,You can't use this panel on this level!  You have to figure out how to solve it with another panel.,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_PANEL_GAME,"This panel lets you change the size of your ship and the astronauts too.

You can also change how fast your ship moves and what it looks like.",,,,
LIGHTSPEED_PANEL_SPAWN,"You can edit the code in this panel to change how often enemies appear and which enemies.

If you make 40 larger, they will appear less often. Smaller and they will appear more often.

Change where it says 'asteroid' to chage which enemy spawns.",,,,
LIGHTSPEED_PANEL_ASTEROID,The code in these panels creates behaviors of an enemy type. This panel works for Asteroids.,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_PANEL_SPINNER,The code in these panels creates behaviors of an enemy type. This panel works for Spinners.,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_PANEL_SQUID,The code in these panels creates behaviors of an enemy type. This panel works for Squids.,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_PANEL_BEAM,The code in these panels creates behaviors of an enemy type. This panel works for Beams.,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_PANEL_POWERUPS,The code in this panel changes how power-ups work.,,,,
LIGHTSPEED_SUCCESS,You're really amazing at this. Great job picking up the key!,,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEED_ABORT,No problem. Come back when you're ready.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_QUESTION,We're almost there! One more level! Ready to find the second access fob?,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,,

LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_EXPLAIN,"Here we are. You'll have to create and beat the final level with every monster and every upgrade.

Press the Flip button to go to the code.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE,"All right, now we need to give it everything. Let's spawn every enemy and powerup in this level.

Click on the Spawn tab and look at the `spawnEnemy()` function.

Let's change it so it spawns any of the 4 enemies: *asteroid*, *spinner*, *squid*, or *beam*.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE_HINT1,Remember the `pickOne()` function? It can be useful here too.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE_HINT2,"Use the `pickOne()` function to return one of the 4 enemies, `'asteroid'`, `'spinner'`, `'squid'` or `'beam'`.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE_HINT3,"`return pickOne('asteroid', 'spinner', 'squid', 'beam');`",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_ABOUTTOPLAY,Ready. Let's play!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_PLAYTEST,You should get all 4 enemies in this level.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_NOTFOUR,I don't see all 4 enemies. Let's go back and check.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_FINISHLEVEL,"Yes, you got all 4 enemies. Now keep playing to the end. That's how we'll get the code.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_SUCCESS,"Well done! I knew you could it. And here's the code, as we expected.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_END,Excellent. As soon as we get all three codes we'll activate the three panels. ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_ABORT,"Go if you must, but I do hope you'll check back later.  ",,,,
