STORY_ADA1_1,"Hi again, {{user_name}}! I was so excited when Dr. Rowe mentioned that the remote student program was approved.

I know it's not easy - you're the first person to test this system, and you have to deal with a totally new group of people.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_2,How are you doing?,,,,
STORY_ADA1_YES,üëç,,,,
STORY_ADA1_NO,üëé,,,,
STORY_ADA1_2_RPOS,"Wow, you *are* a fast learner. I knew you'd be a good fit here - It's great to see you succeed so easily.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_2_RNEG,"Don't get discouraged - I know it's hard to be so limited in what you can say and do. If you just keep going, I'm sure you'll figure it out.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_3,"All of us at the Academy are here to support you. We want you to be able to learn whatever you want!

One of our goals is for you to be able to hack any program - Not just ones we choose, *every* program in the operating system.

Don't worry, we'll teach you how to do it when the time comes.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_4,"This is the beginning of an exciting journey for everyone. We need everyone to learn about computers, programming, and the digital world.

The Earth is changing pretty fast, and as more parts of everyone's lives become digital, people could be left behind.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_5,"You used to have to use a computer to use the internet, and cell phones could only make phone calls.

Now, every cell phone can use the Internet, plus hundreds of different programs - and it's much faster than an old computer was!",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_6,"There is problem with all this technology, though. The people that control a program or a service decide how other people can use it.

If you control a search engine, you can control what information people can find with it.

For example - If you don't like dogs, and you own a search engine, you can just make it so that it will never show pictures of dogs, ever.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_7,"This kind of thing is a problem! This is why it's so important to understand how systems work - you can make the system work *for you*.

If a system is working *for you*, you can use it to get what *you* need, and not what someone else thinks you need.

If you're always limited by other people deciding what you're allowed to learn, or do, or say, you aren't free, no matter what they say.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_8,"So if you don't understand the technology and systems you use, you can never be free - someone else will always control you.

That's why learning about all this is so important!",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_9,"‚Ä¶ Wow, that was quite a speech. Sorry, these things are so important to me that I get really excited and just *go*.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_10,"Hey Ada, how's it going?",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_11,"Hi, Faber! I was just seeing how {{user_name}} was adjusting to the Academy.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_12,"Cool! I actually had some data I wanted to collect - I'm trying to optimize the program the emitters use to project your avatar.

Hopefully I can keep you from accidentally walking through solid objects and things like that.

It's pretty cool to see, but man, if you appeared out of a wall in front of me I'd yell loud enough to wake Dr. Rowe out of a nap!",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_13,"Haha! I just had the image of you jumping, and everything in your toolbelt flying all over‚Ä¶",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_14,"Oh, man, you two should have seen me yesterday when Dr. Hart surprised me in the Maker Space.The first time I knew she was there was when she said ""I think you missed soldering a connection on this board.""

I jumped, my stool tipped over, I fell, and I grabbed the welding bench on the way down...  and it flipped over onto me. What a mess.

Pretty sure I'll be washing metal chips out of my hair for the next week.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_15,"Oh my‚Ä¶ I can just see you, ""Waah!"" and then the bench goes ""CRASH"" and Dr. Hart is just looking at you‚Äî",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_16,"Yeah, like I'm a wrench in the hammer rack‚Ä¶ Oh boy. I couldn't even talk, I was so embarrassed.

But you know, she just smiled and held out her hand to me, saying ""Does that happen a lot? We should get you a better stool.""",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_17,That's very kind of her.,ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_18,"Yeah, she's the best, even if she does scare the living daylights out of me sometimes.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_19,"It's moments like this that make me so glad I'm here, at the Academy.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_20,"If I had left, I'd probably be making some useless gadget for people who don't need more distractions. What about you?",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_21,"Oh, I imagine I'd be at some research center. Maybe working on gravity waves. This is much more rewarding, though.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_22,"So, {{user_name}}, how are you feeling about the Academy so far?",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_22_RPOS,"It's wonderful to see such high motivation. I know you'll go far, farther than we can even predict.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_22_RNEG,"Don't worry if you don't know what to do - Just learn as much as you can.

I didn't know what I really wanted to do until one night when I realized I hadn't left the machine shop in 12 hours, and then I knew.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_23,What was that noise?,ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_24,"Oh! That's my data collector, it's all finished.

Great talking with you guys, but I gotta run and load this into my analysis program if I want it to finish in time.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_25,In time for what?,ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_26,"Dr. Hart got me a spot on the servers so I can run my simulations...

... But she had to fake a maintenence request to get the processor time, so I've got a pretty tight deadline.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_27,"Good luck!

Well, I should be going  - but I'll see you later, {{user_name}}.",ada,,,
