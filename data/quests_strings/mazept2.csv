MAZEPT2_QUESTION,You and Faber found the key? That's great! Ready to get back into the maze and help Riley?,Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Let's go!,,,,
MAZEPT2_LAUNCH,Launch the box app.,,,,
MAZEPT2_LAUNCH_HINT1,Go to the desktop and click on the box icon.,,,,
MAZEPT2_FLIP,Let's flip the app so we can get to the coding panel.,,,,
MAZEPT2_FLIP_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
MAZEPT2_INSTRUCTIONS,"Ah. Here are the Instructions. It's the same as the icons on the front, just written in code.

See that! Someone spelled Jump wrong. No wonder that Instruction doesn't work.

We call that a syntax error. Fix it, then try running the level again!",,,,
MAZEPT2_INSTRUCTIONS_HINT1,See in code where it says `Jumpp` with two p's? That's not how you spell Jump!,,,,
MAZEPT2_INSTRUCTIONS_HINT2,Change it to say `riley.Jump();` Then flip back over and press PLAY.,,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2,"Awesome! That was scary, but thanks to you I got through.

Looks like this level has another error, though!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_HINT1,Look at the Instructions code by flipping the app to the back.,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_HINT2,Then look for Instructions that are spelled wrong or which don't match the other Instructions.,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_HINT3,"I see it! You're supposed to have just ONE period between `riley` and `Up();`

But one of these has TWO periods and another one doesn't have ANY periods! Better fix them!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_HINT4,Change both of them to say `riley.Up();`,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3,"Hmm, look carefully. There’s no way this set of Instructions could EVER finish this level.

But good news, flip the panel over and you can type any Instructions you want!

You don’t have to rearrange the ones you’re given anymore.",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT1,Flip the app over to the back so you can edit the Instructions code.,,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT2,"Because of that pit in this level, you'll need to add at least one Jump Instruction.",,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT3,Delete one of the Instructions and replace it with `riley.Jump();` ,,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT4,"Make sure when you're done that there are 8 Instructions total. No more, no less!",,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS4_ADA1,"Hey Faber. I’ve been wondering something. Saniel said he created this trap, right?",Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS4_FABER1,"Yeah, he made it to trap rogue AIs.",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS4_ADA2,Sure. But then why didn’t he mention that before? Riley has been in this trap for a long time now!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS4_FABER2,"Huh, I didn’t think of that. I guess that’s why he feels guilty.",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS4_ADA3,"Yeah. Hmmm.. this almost reminds me of something.

I feel like something should be clicking into place, but I think I’ve forgotten something important.",Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS5,"Hold on, I think – Riley, Do you see that bundle of files near the Exit!? That’s my missing research!",Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS5_RILEY,Stellar! Just gonna go snap them up right now! ,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_RESEARCH1,"Okay, I'm transmitting the files to you now. You should be see them soon.

Sending them from in here might mean they get a bit distorted in the process. ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_RESEARCH2,"No problem. We can deal with that. Okay, whew! I'm receiving them now. 

Wow, thanks a million Riley. These were missing for so long! I wonder how they got in there? ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS6,I hear something. Do you hear that?,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS6_FELIX,^__MEOW__^ ,Felix,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS6_FABER,There it is again! What the heck IS that thing?,Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS6_RILEY,"I don’t know, but it’s pretty cool!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS6_ADA,I think it’s what’s making this maze harder! Look how difficult this level is!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_IMPASSABLE,"Bzzzrt, bzzrt!  Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",Felix,,,
MAZEPT2_IMPASSABLE_FABER,"Whoa, wait a minute! There’s no way to get past a solid column of walls like that, is there?",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_IMPASSABLE_RILEY,"Oh no! Am I stuck in here forever, then!?",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_SUCCESS,I think I know what to do. Come meet me in the Clubhouse.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_ABORT,Come back whenever you're feeling up for it!,Ada,,,
