MAZEPT2_QUESTION,Let's get back into *Sidetrack* and work with Riley so she can get out!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_QUEST_ACCEPT,"Okay, let's go!",,,,
MAZEPT2_LAUNCH,You and Faber found the key? That's going to really help us! Launch *Sidetrack*.,,,,
MAZEPT2_LAUNCH_HINT1,Go to the desktop and click on the *Sidetrack* icon.,,,,
MAZEPT2_FLIP,This key is going to come in so handy! Let's use it to see what's in the *Toolbox*!,,,,
MAZEPT2_FLIP_HINT1,Press the *Flip* button so we can see the *Sidetrack Toolbox*.,,,,
MAZEPT2_INSTRUCTIONS,"Ah. Now we can access the *Instructions* panel. It's the same as the icons on the front, just written in code.

See that? Someone spelled `jump` wrong, no wonder that *Instruction* doesn't work. The language has to be super exact. 

Pay attention to each letter and correct the spelling in the code. Then try running the level again!",,,,
MAZEPT2_INSTRUCTIONS_HINT1,"See in the code where it says `riley.jumpp();`?

See how jump has two p's? There's only one *p* in jump!",,,,
MAZEPT2_INSTRUCTIONS_HINT2,Change it to say `riley.jump();` Then flip back over and press PLAY.,,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2,"Awesome! That was scary, but thanks to you, I got through.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_B,"Looks like this level has another error, though! Two of them! We need to fix both of them.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_B_HINT1,Look at the *Instructions* code by flipping the app to the back.,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_B_HINT2,Then look for *Instructions* that are spelled wrong or that don't match the other *Instructions*.,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_B_HINT3,See where it says `riley.fooorward();`? Forward has way too many o's! Change it to `riley.forward();`,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_B_HINT4,"Oh, wait, there's another one. Do you see it? Code is case sensitive so that's always something to check.

It should be `riley.jump();` not `riley.Jump();`  See that? lower case j: `jump` not `Jump`    *=^.‿.^=*",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_FIXANDREORDER,"More spelling errors! Whoever wrote these instructions must have been under pressure to get it done quickly!

It's important to remember that once I fix the errors, I'll still need to get the order of the *Instructions* right.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_FIXANDREORDER_FIXED,"Well. I fixed the errors in the code, but I still need to be on my toes here about getting the order of the *Instructions* right.  

All of these details matter if I'm going to get to the exit! It's amazing how if I just pause I can see the way through. Deep! ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3,"Hmm, look carefully. There’s no way this set of *Instructions* could _ever_ finish this level.

But good news, click the *Flip*button, and you can type any *Instructions* you want!

This gives you more choice. You don’t have to just rearrange the ones you’re given anymore.",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT1,Flip to hack so you can edit the code for the *Instructions.*,Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT2,"Because this level has a *Pit*, you'll need to add at least one `jump` Instruction. ",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT3,Delete one of the *Instructions* and replace it with `riley.jump();` See how that works?,Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT4,"Make sure when you're done that there are 8 *Instructions* total. No more, no less!",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS5,"Hold on, Riley, Remember how my research files were missing a while ago? I think I see them!

Yes, that's totally the files I've been looking for. They're over near the *Exit*! How did they get in here? 

You said you saw strange activity in the System area, remember, Riley? I wonder how it's all connected! ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS5_RILEY,"Whoa, yes, I def remember that. That's why I went back into the System. I was trying to help you find your files. 

And well, here we are! How did the files...never mind, I'll just go snap them up right now! ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_RESEARCH1,"Okay, I'm transmitting the files to you now. You should see them soon.

Hope they make it through okay. So many strange things going on in here!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_RESEARCH2,"Okay, whew! I'm receiving them now. Wow, thanks Riley! You're the best! I really can use these files right now! 

So weird though. I wonder how they got in there? ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_IMPASSABLE,"^ = ^ prhhzzhhhrrr  //\\ 
Prhzzhhhhzzhhhhrrrrrrrrr //\\  
myaaaaaoo ^ = ^ ",FelixNet,,,quests/cat-loop
MAZEPT2_IMPASSABLE_FABER,"Whoa, wait a minute! How's Riley gonna get past a solid column of *Walls* like that?",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_IMPASSABLE_RILEY,A solid *Wall*! Let's see how we can get past this one! Would love to get out some day soon!,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_SUCCESS,"I have an idea to get past that wall. We can try out an obscure *Instruction* I recall from my missing research. 

Come meet me in the Clubhouse and we'll go track it down together.",Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_ABORT,Come back whenever you're feeling up for it!,Ada,,,
