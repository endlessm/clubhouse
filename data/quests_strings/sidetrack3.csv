SIDETRACK3_QUEST_NAME,Sidetrack #3 - The Wall,,,,
SIDETRACK3_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
SIDETRACK3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,A new instruction opens up new possibilities to solve Sidetrack's puzzles!,,,,
SIDETRACK3_LAUNCH,"Welcome back to <b>Sidetrack</b>, <b>{{user_name}}</b>. Let's get the program running and dive back in!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK3_LAUNCH_HINT1,"Launch <b>Sidetrack</b> from the desktop.
",riley,,,
SIDETRACK3_INTRO1,"<i>Ahem.</i> Now then, Riley - Can you tell me what's got Faber so keyed-up about this level?",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK3_INTRO2,"Faber really wants to just take a hammer to this wall, but I promised him I had a more... clever solution to the problem. <b>{{user_name}}</b>, can you <b>flip</b> us into the code, please?",riley,,,
SIDETRACK3_INTRO2_HINT1,Click the <b>Flip</b> button.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK3_PUSH,"Drumroll, please! The solution to our new problem is... the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push()</span></tt> instruction! You can use it like any of the other instructions, and it lets you... well... push things out of the way! 
You might as well replace that <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">riley.jump;</span></tt> at position 2, right? A <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">jump</span></tt> <b>Instruction</b>  won't help us in this level.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK3_PUSH_HINT1,"Ah, I see! When your character is lined up with a <b>Wall</b> and about to crash into it, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push()</span></tt> will get you through safely!",ada,,,
SIDETRACK3_PUSH_HINT2,"When you add a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push</span></tt> Instruction, you'll see it on the front of the app. That means you can drag and drop it into a different position, if you need to.",faber,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_29,"Look at all these <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">jump</span></tt> instructions. Not useful at all! We've already tried jumping over a <b>Wall</b> last time, and I can't think it woudl be any more succcessful with a <b>Robot!</b>

Whoever put all these <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">jumps</span></tt> here must not have known about the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push()</span></tt> <b>Instruction</b>.",estelle,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_29__HINT1,"I think if you change all the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">jump()</span></tt> <b>Instructions</b> to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push()</span></tt>, this will work great!",faber,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_30_INTRO,"I think you deserve a ""dev tip"" – <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push()</span></tt> won't work unless you have space for the object to move into.

So... to get through this level, you'll have to avoid 'stacking' walls next to each other - that makes them un-<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push()</span></tt>-able!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_30,"Remember, no space to the right of the object means <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push()</span></tt> won't work!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_30_HINT1,You'll probably need to rewrite most of the <b>Instructions</b> in the Hack panel until you've got what you need to solve this level.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_31_ADA,"Riley, this level looks familliar - are you re-using old levels?",ada,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_31_FABER,"Aw, come on, Ada! It's totally different now that <b>{{user_name}}</b> has the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push()</span></tt> command!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_31_ESTELLE,"Hm. I agree that the experience is different, but for some reason, I can't help but think about a game I once played, where many of the characters were just differently-colored versions of each other... At any rate - let's give <b>{{user_name}}</b> some peace and quiet.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_34_FABER,"Yeah! Push-push-push the night away! Does the animation for the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push()</span></tt> instruction remind you of anything? Something... lunar?",faber,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_34_ESTELLE,"Faber, have you been watching dance party videos again? I thought you were keeping an eye on my simulations last night!",estelle,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_34_FABER_2,"Come on, Dr. Hart! You know I can supervise and supersize at the same time! When you feel the rhythm, you gotta listen!",faber,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_35,"Remember, even though you just got <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push()</span></tt>, it's not always the solution! <i>When you have a brand-new hammer, all you can see is nails!</i>",ada,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_36_ADA,"Oh, wow! This one looks like the hardest one yet!",ada,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_36_SANIEL,"Hmmm. It's certainly difficult, but... oh, fiddlesticks.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK3_LEVEL_36_ADA_2,"I think I see what you just realized, Saniel!",estelle,,,
SIDETRACK3_UNBEATABLE_FABER,Quite. I don't think there's <b>any</b> set of instructions that could solve this level!,saniel,,,
SIDETRACK3_UNBEATABLE_SANIEL,"Really? Oh, yes. I see now. Riley, what's going on here?",ada,,,
SIDETRACK3_UNBEATABLE_RILEY,"Yep, you guessed it! Soon it's going to be time for me to introduce our final tool... but first, you should go clear your heads. The challenges only get tougher! See ya later, <b>{{user_name}}</b>!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK3_ABORT,Come back soon!,riley,,,
