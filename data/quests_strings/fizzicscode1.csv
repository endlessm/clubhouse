FIZZICSCODE1_QUESTION,Hello there. Glad you're still here! I have a bonus challenge for you! Ready to try writing some code?,Ada,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Ready! ,,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_LAUNCH,Great. Go ahead and launch Fizzics and we'll try out some cool new skills. ,,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click on the Fizzics icon on the desktop.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_FLIP,"Okay, remember the *Flip button? Click it to get to the hacking panel. You know the drill.",,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_FLIP_HINT1,Click the *Flip button on the left side of the screen.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_UNLOCK,"Look familiar?  Well, now we're going to explore some new possibilitites. Click on the lock screen and the code section will open.",,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_UNLOCK_HINT1,Click on the lock.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_EXPLANATION1,"Okay, so we're in! Don't worry if it looks strange at first! Take your time to get more familiar with what you see here. 

The coding panel shows variables you can set in Fizzics. When you make a change in the user interface, the code changes too. 

Try increasing the radius for ""species 0"" by clicking on the + button. Did you catch how the code changed when you did that? ",,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_EXPLANATION1_HINT1,"Okay, now change the radius for the orange ball pressing on the + button next to Radius.",,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_EXPLANATION2,Great. Now let's try it the other way. Go to the coding panel and change the radius. See how it changes in the user interface too? ,,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_EXPLANATION2_HINT1,"In the coding panel, change the number value for the variable species[0].radius.",,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_END,"You're getting the hang of it. The parameters for each species are in an array: species[0], species[1], etc.

Feel free to change any value and see how they behave. And remember, the reset button is always there when you need it!

I'm gonna have to get back to figuring out what's going on with my research. Hope you have fun exploring! ",,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_ABORT,Gotta go now? Let's try this again soon! ,,,,
