P5JSINTRO3_QUEST_NAME,"P5JS - ""Painting"" on the canvas",,,,
P5JSINTRO3_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSINTRO3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn some key differences between the setup() and draw() functions that allow you to ""paint""! (Part 3)",,,,
P5JSINTRO3_1,Welcome back! I'm excited to show you what I figured out - this is gonna be fun!,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_2,"First things first - let's get back to the p5.js code editor. You can load your previous sketch (if you saved it at <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4""><a href=""http://editor.p5js.org"">http://editor.p5js.org</a></span></u> ), or get back to where we left off with this one: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4""><a href=""https://editor.p5js.org/madetohack/sketches/nrUIQZX5"">https://editor.p5js.org/madetohack/sketches/nrUIQZX5</a></span></u>",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_3,"Now it's time to take a closer look at the two main functions in this program: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_4,"The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> function happens once, at the very beginning. Currently, it just sets up the canvas and tells it what size to be.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_5,"The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> function happens over and over again, as long as the program is running. Every few milliseconds, it runs the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> code again.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_6,That's why it looks like the circle is moving with our mouse. The program redraws it at our current mouseX and mouseY every few milliseconds!,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_7,"It also redraws the background each time, covering up the last circle we drew.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_8,"But what would happen if we didn't redraw the background each time? What if we only drew it once, at the very beginning?",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_9,"Let's find out! If we move the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background()</span></tt> line of code to the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> function, it will only happen once, right after the canvas is created.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_10,"Try it - move the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background();</span></tt> line to right after the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">createCanvas();</span></tt> line. Make sure you put it before the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">}</span></tt> so it's in the right function.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_11,Now run the program - what happens?,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_12,"Woah! Is that what you thought would happen? If you want to start over, you can just hit the play button again.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_13,So... did you notice how there's always a circle at the top left corner when you start? Why do you think that is?,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_14,Let's think about it - where is your mouse when the program starts? What values are mouseX and mouseY probably set to?,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_15,"Exactly - your mouse is outside the canvas, so it draws the circle as close as it can. ",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_16,Try weaving your mouse in and out of the canvas - you can decorate all the corners without touching the middle!,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_17,Can you figure out how to draw a happy face?,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_18,"If you still have an outline around your circle, try using <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">strokeWeight(0)</span></tt> to get rid of it and have a true paintbrush.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_19,"Woohoo! What else can you paint? To take a screenshot of your creation, press the 'print screen' key on your keyboard - the image will show up in your <b>Pictures</b> folder.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO3_20,I'lll see you next time - we're going to keep digging deeper into <b>p5.js</b> and see what we can find!,riley,,,
