BOOTQUEST2_NOTINSTALLED,"""Uh-oh! Looks like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Sublime Text</span></tt> isn't installed!

You need to download it from the App Center because we'll be using it for this activity.

Click the icon named <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">App Center</span></tt> on the Desktop, then search for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Sublime Text</span></tt>, and install it.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Let's keep the learning juices flowing and level-up your web development skills. In this activity, we will learn how to link files for Bootstrap to work.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_2,"We're going to pick up where we left off from the first Bootstrap quest so that we can focus on the most important parts. For this project, we'll be using Chrome (not Chromium) as our default browser. If you haven't gone through the first Bootstrap quest, we highly recommend that you work through that activity first.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_3,"Great! Let's get started. We've added the files you're going to use in your Documents folder - let's take a look at them. The lower-left corner of the screen with the icons is called the <b>taskbar</b>. Click the yellow folder to launch the file explorer. Click the Documents link on the left panel of the window and open the <b>myproject</b> folder. The folder should contain the index.html file and three folders: <b>css</b>, <b>images</b>, and <b>js</b>. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_4,"The images folder holds the images you will be using, the <b>CSS</b> folder holds all of the styling files, and the <b>JS</b> folder contains all of the Javascript files needed for your site. Let's take a look at the page we'll be using in this activity- <b>right-click</b> on the <b>index.html</b> file, and select <b>Open With Google Chrome</b>. If you are using a Hack computer, use two fingers and click on the mouse pad to <b>right-click</b>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_5,"Super! During load-time (when the page is loading), Chrome is using the internet to pull in (or <b>import</b>) the Bootstrap code from another location for your project. What happens to the webpage when there's no internet to get those files? Let's turn off your Wi-Fi and see what happens.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_6,"Turn off your Wi-Fi by clicking the battery icon located at the bottom right corner of the screen, click <b>Wi-Fi Settings</b>, and click <b>Turn Off</b>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_7,"Refresh the Chrome project browser by pressing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl + shift + r</span></tt> The browser tab that says *Hello, world!"" is your project browser. Oh no! Without the code in those Bootstrap files, Chrome wasn't able to build your page properly. Let's fix your website.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_8,"Open the <b>index.html</b> file in your project folder by clicking the yellow folder in the <b>taskbar</b> located at the bottom left corner of your screen, click the Documents link on the left panel, and open the <b>myproject</b> folder.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_9,"Using Sublime Text, we can open the index.html file and fix the code to return it to glory. Right-click on the index.html file and click <b>Open With Other Application</b>. If <b>Sublime Text</b> is already selected, click on it, and then the <b>Select</b> button at the top right corner of the window. Otherwise, click <b>View All Applications</b>, click <b>Sublime Text</b>, and click the <b>Select</b> button at the top right corner of the window. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_10,Great! Sublime Text should launch with the code for your website. Take a look at your code and try to guess why your website broke after we turned off the internet. The page doesn't load properly because we are using links that point to files on the internet. Let's find and fix those links.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_11,"On line 9, delete all the text after <b>href=</b> but keep the last <b>&gt;</b>. For example, Line 9 should look like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_12,"Awesome! We will add code to tell Chrome to look for the <b>Bootstrap CSS</b> files in the <b>CSS</b> folder on your computer. After <b>href=</b> on line 9, type in the following <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""css/bootstrap.min.css""</span></tt> So, line 9 should look like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/bootstrap.min.css""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_13,"The dot mark (.) at the right side of the tab indicates that you have unsaved changes. Save your Sublime Text index.html file by hitting <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl + s</span></tt> You'll know the file saved when the dot mark (.) is replaced with a cross mark (x). Return to the Chrome browser by clicking the Chrome icon at the taskbar. Let's see what happens.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_14,"Refresh the Chrome project tab by hitting <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl + r</span></tt>, and the stying for your page should return. We're not done just yet because the carousel at the top isn't moving. Let's keep working on the site.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_15,"Go back to Sublime Text by clicking the grey box with the <b>S</b> taskbar located at the bottom left corner of the screen. Similar to the first link you fixed earlier, lines 89 and 93 also points to an external website. Let's fix those too.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_16,"We're almost done. For lines 89 and 93, delete all of the text just after <b>src=</b> but keep <b>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b>. For example, the line should look like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;script src=&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_17,"Super! Let's tell Chrome where to find the <b>jQuery</b> file on your computer. Type in the following after <b>src=</b> <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js""</span></tt> So, line 89 should look like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;script src=""js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_18,"For line 93, type in the following after <b>src=</b> <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js""</span></tt> So, line 93 should look like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;script src=""js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_19,"Save your index.html file by hitting <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl + s</span></tt> You'll know the file saved when the dot mark (.) is replaced with a cross mark (x).",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_20,Return to the Chrome browser by clicking the Chrome icon located at the taskbar and refresh the Chrome project tab. Let's see what happens.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_21,One final bit and you're done. The text in the cards at the bottom are all blue because they are links. We can fix that by linking our own CSS sheet on line 12.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_22,"In between the quotation marks, type in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">css/style.css</span></tt> The line should look like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/style.css""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_23,"Save your index.html file by hitting <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl + s</span></tt> You'll know the file saved when the dot mark (.) is replaced with a cross mark (x). ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_24,"You did it! By completing this activity, you learned how to create an <b>HTML</b> website using Bootstrap and link downloaded files from your computer to make it work. You've leveled up your skills as a Web Developer! Now, try using different Bootstrap components to add more content to your site and personalize it. Make it your own!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_25,"When you're done, take a screenshot of your work by pressing the <b>prt src</b> button next to your Hack's power button. It is automatically saved to your <b>Pictures</b> folder. Finally, share your pic on social media and tag us using #MadeToHack.",daemon,,,
