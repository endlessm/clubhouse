LEVIHACKDEX_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes! ,Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO,"Whew. so glad to see these! You’ve heard about Leviathan, right? We’re all Leviathan fans around here.

LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO1,"Wait, what’s going on? This is illegible. Everything’s scrambled. 

Finally got these back and now they’re not legible.",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO2,"That looks challenging, but I think I can help move this along. Solving cryptology puzzles is one of my side studies.

LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION2,So cool.   I remember finding that in an old folder that belonged to Leviathan. What does it do?,Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION3,Riley can use it in the maze to push walls out of her way. It’s going to be essential in getting her past this obstacle. ,Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_END,Well this is a good development! Let’s go back to RileyMaze and see if Riley needs more help. ,Ada,,,
