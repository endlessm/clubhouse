LEVIHACKDEX_QUESTION,"Hey there, would you like to join me in looking at my research files?",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes! ,Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_LAUNCH,The files should be there on the desktop. Launch the *Leviathan* app.,Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO,"Whew, so glad to see –– wait, all the text is encrypted! I *finally* get my research back and now I can't read it!

I've been gathering materials on the mysterious historical hacker known as *Leviathan* for quite some time. 

*Document 1103* covers Leviathan's takedown of an especially wily AI. But to read it, we need to decrypt it!",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO1,Maybe Estelle can help us with this! She's a total genius with ciphers.,Faber,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO2,Did I hear that someone is having trouble with a cipher?,Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO3,"Estelle! That was fast even for you, thanks for responding so quickly. 

We'd like your eyes on this puzzle - Something tells me you'll be able to help.",Faber,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO4,"Let's see. Mmm hmm. I think I can move this along, I've done a bit of this in my day.",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PREFLIP,Let's find out what the trouble is. We need to get in there and adjust some settings in the hacking panel. ,Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_GIVEKEY,Try this key and see if it gets us where we need to go. Click the Flip button and see if it's locked!,Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_UNLOCK,"Ah, beautiful. ",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT,"So, here we are. See that number labeled *Cipher*, in the *Effects panel*? Try changing that and see what happens.",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT_HINT1,Try any number. Even the wrong guess will give us more information about what we're working with. ,Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT_HINT2,"Once you try a number, Flip back to see what effect it has on the text.",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT2,"Aha! Look at the letters in the files. They've changed. They've also changed in *Cipher Output*, as well. Interesting!

This confirms my theory. This is encoded with a rotational cipher, where the letters are shifted over in the alphabet.

For example, if you take the word *CAT* and shift all the letters over one, you get *DBU*. ",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT2_ADA,"Maybe the page holds some clues? What can we still see clearly? Just for fun, try counting the cat tails! ",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3,"This looks like it might be a long, difficult process. Any tips, Estelle?",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3_HINT1,"Ciphers like this one only change letters, not where letters appear in words. I think I see some patterns in the data.",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3_HINT2,"Think about it. *OCZ* appears many times. 

So, if we compare *OCZ* to a common 3-letter word like *THE*, that will actually tell us alot!",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3_HINT3,"Enter *OCZ* into *Cipher Input* and try different numbers until you get *THE* in *Cipher Output*. 

Solving the cipher for OCZ will help you solve the whole cipher!",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT_SUCCESS,Excellent! That did the trick! Now we can read all these files. ,Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_BACKGROUND,"Hey, check out that sketch at the bottom right. I was wondering if that might be useful. ",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION,"Ah, yes. What we’re looking at is a *Sidetrack Instruction* called `push`.

Now that's a signature Leviathan move – removing an obstacle.",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION2,"Tiiiiight! I knew you'd be able to help us with this, Estelle! Thank you!",Faber,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION3,"Amazing. Thank you, Estelle. What does this new instruction do?",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION4,"It does just what it says. You can use it to move a *Wall* that's blocking you. 

Riley can use it in *Sidetrack* to push *Walls* out of her way. It’s going to be essential in getting her past obstacles.",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION5,"Well, this is getting very interesting! Why was there a note about Saniel's AI trap in Leviathan's code sketchbooks?",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION6,"Ada, I think that's something you're going to have to ask Saniel about! ",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_SUCCESS,"I am totally going to do that. Right now, we've got to get back to Riley!

Come find me in the Clubhouse when you're ready!",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_ABORT,"Okay, come back when you're ready! Riley still needs our help to get through the maze, so come back soon!",Ada,,,
