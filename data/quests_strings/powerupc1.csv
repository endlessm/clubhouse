POWERUPC1_QUESTION,One more Power-up to go. Ready?,Saniel,,,
POWERUPC1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Always!,,,,
POWERUPC1_LAUNCH,Start by launching Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPC1_EXPLAIN,Now we're going to create Power-up `upgrade`. Go to the coding panel.,,,,
POWERUPC1_CODE,"This level is already spawning Power-ups of type `upgrade`. So let's change its special power. 

Click on the Power-up tab and look for the `activatePowerup()` function.

We need to add a new `if` statement for type `upgrade`. Let's try shrinking the ship! 

It's on a timer, like invulnerability, so we'll use `ship.shrinkTimer = 5;`",,,,
POWERUPC1_CODE_HINT1,"Just before the final `}` on the last line, type in `if (powerUpType === upgrade)`",,,,
POWERUPC1_CODE_HINT2,And then `ship.shrinkTimer = 5;`. Then flip back around to see if that worked.,,,,
POWERUPC1_ABOUTTOPLAY,Let's play the level now.,,,,
POWERUPC1_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPC1_PLAY_AGAIN,Let's give this level another try!,,,,
POWERUPC1_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Click *Restart.* ,,,,
POWERUPC1_PLAYTEST,Those Power-ups should shrink our ship now.,,,,
POWERUPC1_NOSHRINK,The ship is not shrinking for some reason. Let's check the code.,,,,
POWERUPC1_OTHER_PICKED,Looks like you picked a Power-up of a different type.,,,,
POWERUPC1_NOT_PICKED,You couldn't pick any Power-up? Odd. Are they actually being spawned?,,,,
POWERUPC1_FINISHLEVEL,There you go. It should make finishing the level much easier.,,,,
POWERUPC1_SUCCESS,Perfect. A few more tweaks on this Power-up and we'll be almost ready.,,hurray,,
POWERUPC1_ABORT,Hope you'll come back soon. We need your help!,,,,
