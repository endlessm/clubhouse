FIZZICSCODE2_QUESTION,Isn't the coding panel on Fizzics cool? Let's check out what we can do with it!,Riley,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Let's do it!,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_LAUNCH,I bet you know how to launch Fizzics by now.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_LAUNCH_HINT1,Go to the desktop and click on Fizzics.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_FLIP,Let's get in there. Press the Flip button.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_FLIP_HINT1,Pssst... press the big button on the left.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_EXPLANATION,"One of the cool things about code is that you're not tied to someone else's idea. You can let your imagination run wild.

So, we know that if you set some gravity on an object, it falls down, right? But what happens if you set the gravity negative? Try it!",,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_EXPLANATION_HINT1,Set the gravity for the orange ball negative.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_EXPLANATION_HINT2,Set species[0].gravity to -30.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_END,"They fall upwards!! Did you expect that? There are lots of other cool things to play with. See if you find any other neat tricks.

See you at the Clubhouse!",,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_ABORT,That's cool. Drop by whenever you want to try again.,,,,
