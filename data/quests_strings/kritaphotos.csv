KRITAPHOTOS_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Start with a photo, end with a work of art! You'll learn to change the look of a photograph and add all kinds of decorations.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_1,"Hey there, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Good to see you again. ",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_2,"Let's get going! I'll open Krita for you - and then you'll need to open up a file called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Photos.kra</span></tt>. It should be sitting in your <b>Pictures</b> folder.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_3,"Now, you might think it's just <b>one</b> photo. But you would be wrong...",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_4,"Check the <b>Layers</b>. Remember where they are? Over to the right? Yeah, we've got a couple of 'em this time.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_5,Now I'm gonna show you a cool trick. You can make <b>Layers</b> appear and disappear.,,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_6,"See the <b>rounded eye symbol</b> to the <b>left</b> of each <b>Layer</b>? Click on one. The eye turns grey and closes, symbolizing that we can't see that <b>Layer</b> anymore.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_7,Try hiding and showing different layers until you've seen all 3 photos.,,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_8,Now hide all the layers except your favorite. Make sure you have that one selected. Otherwise you won't be able to make any changes to it.,,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_9,"And now we're going to actually use that brush tool on the left. Select the little paintbrush near the top left of the Tools section. This is called the Freehand Brush Tool, and it will let us draw on top of the picture.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_10,"Now you might think that one paintbrush is gonna be pretty basic. Think again! This Freehand Brush Tool can turn into any number of brushes, markers, stamps, and swirls! The Freehand Brush Tool can be changed to any of the Brush Presets. ",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_11,"See the toolbar on the right? Just below the Layers, it says Brush Presets. If you can't see the choices very well, you can resize that part of the sidebar, called a Docker.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_12,"Find the tiny row of gray dots, and your mouse will turn into some arrows with a bar. Now you can click and drag to make the box taller or shorter! Pretty cool, huh?",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_13,You can make Krita look the way you want so that your favorite parts are easier to find and use.,,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_14,"There are SO MANY Brush Presets to choose from though! If you want, you can trim it down. See where it says 'All' under the 'Brush Presets' label? That's a dropdown menu where you can pick categories. Here are some of my favorites...",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_15,"I like 'FX' because it's like adding cool effects, layered on top of your picture. 'Textures' will lay down some really cool looking patterns. And 'Digital' has all kinds of exciting brushes, including some that make it look like you're bending reality!",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_16,"To try a brush, just click on it. Make sure you have the Freehand Brush Tool (paintbrush) selected on the left! Now click or drag it across your picture to see what happens.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_17,"If you don't like it, you can always Undo. For any changes that you don't like, just press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Z</span></tt> or hit the Undo arrow up top.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_18,Don't forget you can also select different colors for the brushes.,,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_19,"You ready for some more ways to change it up? You can change the Size of your brush, making star sparkles and things as big or small as you want. (Yeah, there's really a brush that makes shiny stars.)",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_20,"Look up at tippy top right, where you'll see a bar that says 'Size' and has a number with 'px.' That 'px' stands for pixel. So the number you see next to it is how many pixels your brush will cover up.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_21,"See how some of the bar is filled in and some of it is empty? You can click or drag to change the size. If your brush gets too big, it'll cover the whole page. If it's too small, you might not see the changes.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_22,"Now, are you ready for even MORE customization?",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_23,"First, it's time to Save! Hey, don't look at me like that. Nobody likes losing their art, trust me. ""Save early and often!""",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_24,"Now, you can also make whatever you paint look see-through! This is called changing the Opacity. Because something you can't see through, like a solid object, is called ""opaque.""",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_25,"Look for the Opacity bar next to the Size bar. It probably says 100%, but you can change it. Try different numbers and see how it changes the look of your additions.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_26,Got it? You're doing great. There's a million ways to make art with Krita. The great thing is that none of them are wrong. Once you find something you like just GO FOR IT!! You can always come back and explore more later.,,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_27,"If you need to zoom in to see what you're doing, that's totally an option. Gotta stamp that heart juuuuust right.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_28,"You can use the slider on the very bottom left, but it can be hard to get it right where you want it.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_29,"I like to use the keyboard shortcuts you can see in the View &lt; Canvas menu. Just click the 'View' menu, then hover over the 'Canvas' option. You can zoom in or out here. If you memorize the keyboard shortcut, you don't even have to open these menus again!",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_30,"Now, let's say you wanted that brush from five minutes ago, but you don't remember where to find it. Good news! You can still find it in 'Brush Preset History,' the tab right next to 'Brush Presets.'",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_31,"This will give you a list of your most recent brushes and you can click to select the one you want. When you're done, just click on the 'Brush Presets' tab again to look for new ones.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_32,"If you're feeling inspired, you might want to decorate more. Try using photos of friends and family! Create the photos you want to see in the world!!",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_33,"And with that, whew, I'm taking a break. Have fun, and see you next time!",,,,
