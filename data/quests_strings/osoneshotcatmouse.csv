OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Start learning about the command-line, the most powerful tool on any computer. (Part 1 of 4)",,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_1,Hey <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Ada's always saying we should search out new things to do - so I want to try teaching you some tricks in the <b>Terminal</b>!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_2,"The Terminal is mondo cool, it's where the REAL magic in the OS happens. You know those scenes in movies where they hack into computer systems?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_3,"That's <b>supposed</b> to look like the Terminal. I'm going to teach you the <b>real</b> stuff, though!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_4,"Just a couple things before we start - when I do text like <b>this</b>, it's important.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_5,"Text <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">like this</span></tt> is a command - something you could type into the terminal. Pay close attention to spelling, captialization, and spacing, the Terminal is <b>very</b> picky.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_6,"Also, pay attention to the results of what you type - If there's an error, you probably mistyped something.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_7,Let's get started - I'll open the Terminal open for you.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_8,"Nice. See that text on the left there? That's called the <b>prompt</b>. All we need to worry about right now is the part after the colon (:), because it tells you where you are in the <b>filesystem</b>. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_9,"The <b>filesystem</b> is all the files and folders on your computer - think of it like a big set of filing cabinets. Each cabinet is full of folders, and each folder can have other folders inside it, and so on. That's why we need something to tell us where we are!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_10,"Right now, the part after the colon (:) should show <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">~</span></tt> (tilde), which means we're in your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">home</span></tt> directory, where all your files are.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_11,"To see what's around you in the current folder, you use the command <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_12,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> is a command that <b>lists</b> everything in the directory you're in. It's like looking around in a room.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_13,"Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> (lower-case L, lower-case S) into the Terminal, then hit <b>Enter</b>. In general, if I ever ask you to type something, you can assume that you should hit <b>Enter</b> afterwards. If you shouldn't, I'll make sure to telll you!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_14,"Using <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> should have shown you a list of items, then given you a new prompt.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_15,"Whenever you see a new, empty prompt, the Terminal is ready for another command. It's <b>super</b> fast!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_16,"If you had already saved any files in your home directory, you might see them in the results of that <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_17,"Hmm, did you create a directory named <b>yarnbasket</b>? Let's check it out!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_18,"To go into another folder, you use the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd</span></tt> command. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_19,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd</span></tt> stands for <b>change directory</b> (directory is another word for folder). Unlike <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd</span></tt> needs some information after it to tell it which directory you want to change to.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_20,"Since we want to go into <b>yarnbasket</b>, type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd yarnbasket</span></tt>, then hit <b>Enter</b>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_21,"Your prompt should now say <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt>, since you typed in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd yarnbasket</span></tt>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_22,"Now that you're inside this folder, type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> again to see what's inside.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_23,"Huh, that's a lot of folders of yarn! Well, I guess we're going to have to investigate it. Who leaves all that yarn lying around?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_24,"Before we go any deeper, I should tell you how to get back out of this folder - Just in case you accidentally <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd</span></tt> somewhere that you don't mean to.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_25,"To get back out of a folder, you use a special version of <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd</span></tt> - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ..</span></tt> That's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd</span></tt> (space) <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">period period</span></tt>. It takes you back ""up"" into the folder that contains the folder you're in.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_26,"Let's give that a try, type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ..</span></tt> and see where it takes us. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_27,"Look at your <b>prompt</b> - do you see where we ended up? We're in your home directory! That makes sense, since we did <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd yarnbasket</span></tt> (that took us into <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt>) and then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ..</span></tt> (which brought us back to where we started).",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_28,"Now let's get back to where we were a minute ago - Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd yarnbasket</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_29,"And now, let's enter the directory <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">redyarn</span></tt> - Guess what command we need to use?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_30,"Yep! <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd redyarn</span></tt> will get us where we want to go. Once you've done that, use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> to look around in this new directory.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_31,"Nothing here. Hmm. Well, now we need to get back out, which means <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ..</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_32,"Next up, let's investigate <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">greenyarn</span></tt>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_33,"We'll type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd greenyarn</span></tt>, <b>enter</b>, then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt>, <b>enter</b>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_34,"Nothing again! Why is this called ""yarnbasket"" if there's no ""yarn"" in these folders? Let's go back, using <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ..</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_35,"Now that we're back in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt>, let's check that last folder. Take us into <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">blueyarn</span></tt> (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd blueyarn</span></tt>), and then let's see what we've got! (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt>)",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_36,"Aha! Do you see that? Our <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> turned up a ""mouse""! No wonder there was no yarn, this mouse ate it all!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_37,"Fortunately, I have a perfect solution. Felix! Come take care of this mouse!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_38,"<i>Nyan, brrrp? Miao&^w!</i>",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_39,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;Felix licks his nose, and vanishes into an air duct.&gt;</span></tt>",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_40,"I love that cat, but he drives me nuts sometimes. He never does anything when you need him to!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_41,"Well, if Felix won't help us, we'll just have to use a different ""cat"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_42,"The program <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> helps you open files - it shows their data on the screen, right in the terminal.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_43,"You can use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> on any file - just type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat filename</span></tt> - but only text files will show you anything you can read. If you forget to type a filename after <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt>, you can use <b>Ctrl-C</b> to get back to the prompt.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_44,"OK, let's check out that file - type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat mouse</span></tt> to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> the file named <b>mouse</b>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_45,LOL! Looks like Felix is playing pranks on us.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_46,"It says the mouse got away, huh? To ""greener pastures"". Maybe that's a clue to the color of the yarn he's hiding in!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_47,"Let's go check that other folder! To do that, we'll need to go back up to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt>, then back down into the other folder. Remember, use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ..</span></tt> to get out of a folder.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_48,"Now that we're back in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt>, let's go into <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">greenyarn</span></tt>, then use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> to see if that mouse is hiding there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_49,"Ha! I see a new file! Let's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> that file and see if we got him!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_50,"Not again! This is a clever mouse, but he's running out of places to hide. Quick, back up to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt> and then down into <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">redyarn</span></tt>!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_51,"Ok, now that we're in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">redyarn</span></tt>, let's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> and see what's hiding in here.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_52,"Now we've got him! Let's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> that file!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_53,"Gotcha! But he is awfully cute, I suppose. We'll let him go today. After all, he isn't doing anything bad, really.",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_54,"That was fun! You learned <b>ls</b>, <b>cd</b>, and <b>cat</b> - and I've got much more planned for next time!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_55,Catch you later!,riley,,,
