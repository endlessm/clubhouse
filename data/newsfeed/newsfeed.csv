At 15, her cousin was diagnosed with breast cancer so she created Cloud4Cancer, an AI breast cancer app that took first place in the 2012 Google Science Fair.

2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber Well, she’s a very… formidable woman. Quite intelligent. Very driven. She has a mischievous streak, definitely. I was thinking that she might appreciate a bound edition of the last 5 issues of The Journal Of Computational Linguistics – very handy."

2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Saniel definitely. tiny little bits of hardware sailing off into the deep black… some seriously good engineering on those things.
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber Yes, well, you know there was a golden record attached to one of those probes – it contained greetings, music, and messages that tried to represent as much of Earth’s culture as possible. I’m going to create a copy. That will be my gift."
